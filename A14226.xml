            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He was not paſt a dayes iourney or two from the ſhore, but he went to wracke tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the miſdealing of thoſe, to
<pb facs="tcp:11804:3"/> whoſe ſafe conduct he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelfe, and by the winds was driuen backe againe to the coaſt of Aeolia. His weather bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten men, and himſelfe being refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed as time &amp; place then ſerued, he ſet forward to Aeolus his Court, hoping to find ſuch entertainment as he found before. Not daring ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly to enter in, he reſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at the Porter his lodge, where he heard theſe words:

            <p>It may be they moued his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence a little, becauſe they touched his former eſtate, yet hauing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conceite of others in that place he let them paſſe, and preaſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the preſence of the King, ſitting not farre off with his Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie about him, to whom he ſpake

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Rithmetick is the Art of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This definition is ſhort &amp; plaine, being drawen from the end of Arithmetike, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which ſort other Arts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are defined.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>It appeareth then that the Subiect of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetike (that is to ſay, the thing wherea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that Art is wholly occupied and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto all the rules thereof are to be referred) is number.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Number is a Multitude conſiſting of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the definition of the ſeuenth booke of Euclide. Ariſtotle in his Categories ſeemeth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:11804:6"/> to define it thus. A number is a diſcreet quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie not hauing poſition but order. The which definition agreeth with that of Euclid, ſauing that it diſtinguiſheth an vnitie from a point by a certaine contrary qualitie which is in them; attributing to a point poſition or place, to an vnitie only order &amp; conſequence. Whereby it appeareth that a number is the ioyning togither of things following one an other in order not touching one the other much leſſe cleauing togither, and that in ſuch ſort that you can not determine any bond or common knot in them, whereby they ſhould be knit togither and continued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The beginning of number in an Vnitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An vnitie is that, whereby euery thing that is, is ſaid to be one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An vnitie properly is no number, becauſe it is no multitude, for multitudes onely are numbred: neither is it a part of a number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that euery part of a number ought alſo to be a number. It anſweareth in proportion to a moment, and to a point: whereof the one is the beginning of time, the other of magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and yet no part of them: as Ariſtotle proueth in the fifth and in the beginning of the ſixth booke of Phiſicks: yet in Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall numeration it is wont to be taken for a number, and that the leaſt that may be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The diuiſion of number ſhall be drawen out of numeration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scholemen deuide numbers into Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gites,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:11804:6"/> articles &amp; mixt numbers: to this end as I think that they might make a diſtinction in the naturall conſequence of numbers: wherin firſt of all the nine ſimple figures are to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, the which the number 10. ſucceedeth as it were a knot knitting them to the mixt numbers following. But for ſo much as this is no lawfull diuiſion of numbers, we will draw an other out of the laſt part of Numeration, which we call Diuiſion, the vſe whereof is exceeding great. In the meane time if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer two numbers metaphorically ſo termed (which haue giuen occaſion to the reſt vſed of the Latines who ſay <hi>Arithmeticum paucio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res habere digitos, plures autem articulos homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne)</hi> if that diuiſion I ſay do diſpleaſe you, you may peraduenture more fitly deuide num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers into ſimple, decades and compounde numbers.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The figures are conſidered eyther by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alone, or one with another. By themſelues alone, when they are without compoſition, or as it were without compoſition, for then the firſt nine haue a certaine value.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The tenth which hath the forme of a circle ſignifieth nothing ſtanding by it ſelfe alone, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed with the reſt, it maketh to the increaſe of their value.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Figures are conſidered one with an other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ioyned together, and then the proceſſe and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their places encreaſeth their value.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For ſo much as euery number may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed infinitely, therefore by reaſon of their diuers encreaſe amou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting to tens, hundreds, thouſands ten thouſands, &amp;c. it is vnpoſſible to write euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a diuers figure. For then ſhould the varietie of the figures be alſo infinite. But what is wanting in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, that their places through often repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them, maketh vp. In continuance of which places the figures take vnto them a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſignification, &amp; that ſo much the greater by how much the more in ioyning the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers togither they come nearer to the left ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The places of numbers are diſtinguiſhed by degrees and periods. A degree is a place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the value of each number is gathered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A degree is of two ſorts: the firſt is of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple numbers, the other of multiplyed numbers, to wit, the ſecond degree is of tens, the thirde of hundreds, and ſo foorth after the ſame manner in the reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Numbers according to the cuſtome of all people proceede from the left hand toward the right, ſo that the leaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber occupieth the laſt place next to the right hand. Wherefore the laſt figure in value is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11804:9"/> the firſt, &amp; euery figure in the firſt place kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his firſt and proper ſignification. In the other places euery one is armed with a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power, to wit, with his owne and with an other borrowed for a time. For this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is generally to be obſerued in the places: that, that which followeth is twiſe as much as that which went before.</p>
               <p>As for example: the figure 4. by it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is foure: and ſo much alſo it ſignifieth in the firſt degree. But being remoued into the ſecond, it ſignifieth fortie, as you ſee here, 40. Againe, being ſet in the third degree it is ten times ſo much as it was in the ſecond: that is, foure hundred, as here, 400. And ſo forth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner both in the other figures and degrees.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A periode is that vvhich comprehendeth the degrees, and is eyther perfect, conſiſting of three degrees, or imperfect contayning leſſe then three.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To conclude, that Period vvhich conſiſteth but of one trinitie or ternarie of degrees is ſingle, but that vvhich conſiſteth of more then one, is compound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As 1 2 3 is a perfect ſingle period: 1 2 3 4 5 6 is a perfect compounde periode. Alſo 1 2 is an vnperfect ſingle periode: 1 2 3 4, 1 2 3 4 5 is an vnperfect co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pound period. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. is an vnperfect triple periode. In numbers the degrees are to the periodes, as the commata &amp; cola are the periodes in an oration.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And here vve haue to deale vvith numbers, either of one terme, or more. Whole numbers are vvritten vvith one terme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As 20, 24, 360, 1234, 1578, they be alſo called numbers of one bande or rancke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hovv vvhole numbers of a ſingle periode ſhould be ſet downe, may be gathered by tha vvhich hath beene ſaide before. But that the compound numbers may be expreſſed, they muſt vvith prickes or ſmall lines be deuided into ſingle periods, and be ſo vttered that at the firſt pricke vve name a thouſand, at the ſecond a thouſand thouſand, at the third a thouſand thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and ſo forth going forward after the ſame order, till vve haue numbred the vvhole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Numbers be they neuer ſo great may eaſily be expreſſed, if diſtinguiſhing them with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodes you vtter them by partes, in ſuch ſort that both the value of the figures and the power of the degrees, may gouerne them when they be vttered. So that at the end of the firſt periode you ſhall name a thouſand, at the end of the ſecond a thouſand thouſand (which ſome call a million) and to be ſhort, at the end of the third periode, you ſhall name
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:11804:10"/> a thouſand thouſand thouſand: obſeruing the ſame encreaſe in all the periodes following, be they neuer ſo many. Hereupon it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe that the leaſt ſignifying figure of the periode following, is greater then any of the periode going before. Moreouer the ready vttering of numbers maketh a man to write them ſpeedily, &amp; contrariwiſe the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy writing of them maketh a man to vtter them readily. For example, hauing diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed this number 34˙567˙890 with prickes you ſhall expreſſe it thus beginning at the left hand. At the firſt periode you ſhall ſay thirtie foure thouſand thouſand or elſe thirty foure millions. At the ſecond, fiue hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſixtie ſeuen thouſand. At the third eight hundred and nintie.</p>
               <p>The number following you ſhall expreſſe thus 2˙016˙542˙009˙873. Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thouſand thouſand thouſand: then ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand thouſand thouſand, fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fourtie two thouſand thouſand, 9. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand eight hundred ſeuentie three.</p>
               <p>The Romaines were wont to number by hundred thouſands. The which faſhion if you liſt to follow you ſhal ſet down a pricke next to the ſecond degree of the ſecond periode &amp; expreſſe the other numbers following, as you did the firſt. As in this number 77˙89˙320, you ſhall ſay thus ſeuenty ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hundred foure ſcore and nine thouſand three hundred and twentie. After this manner Plinie in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:11804:10"/> booke 108. Chap. affirmeth according to the ſaying of Artemidorus that the longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the earth inhabited Weſt ward from the pillers of Hercules in India, is eighty fiue hundred ſeuentie and eight thouſand miles. The which number muſt be ſet downe thus.</p>
               <p>85|78|000.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus much for the notation of numbers of one terme: now follow the numbers of manie termes. And they be eyther of one kinde as partes (which we commonly call fractions,) or of diuerſe kinds as mixt numbers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partes are ſet downe with two termes deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded one from an other with a line: whereof the vppermoſt numbreth the parts, the neathermoſt nameth them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although an vnitie by it ſelf of it own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can not be deuided, yet if we regarde the ſubiect thereof, or the magnitude whereto it is applied, it may be deuided. And yet the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the number proceeding of this diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do not ariſe of the very vnitie it ſelfe, but of the deuiding of the magnitude, that is: they come not of the vnitie as it is by it ſelfe alone, but as it is ioyned to ſome other thing. As a ſhilling can not be deuided as it is one, but as it is a peece of money, which cuſtomablie is deuided into teſtons, groates, three pences, two pences, pence and half pence, &amp;c. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although partes be called by the name of numbers, and are written with the figures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:11804:11"/> to whole numbers: yet in very deede they are no numbers, if Euclides definition of a number be true. But in the notation of theſe partes there are two things to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, the quantitie of the parts (for a whole number may haue many parts, both great and finall) and the number of them. Hereupon it commeth that when they be written they require two termes or numbers: whereof the vppermoſt declareth the number of the parts the which are to be found out, whereupon it is called the Number, or Numerator. But the neathermoſt naming the parts of the whole, expreſſeth their quantitie: wherefore it is called the name, or the Denominator. As 1/2 ſignifieth one part of the whole deuided into two halfes, that is; one halfe. 1/3 one third part 3/4 three fourth partes, or three quarters. 5/6 fiue ſixth partes, that is, fiue partes of the whole deuided into ſixe parts.</p>
               <p>Hereby it appeareth that the greater the Denominator is, the leſſe is the quantitie of the partes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partes are eyther principall, or of the ſecond ſort. The one haue their originall of the firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of the vvhole, the other are parcels of the principall parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They may be called Simple &amp; Deriuatiue parts: whereof the one ariſeth of the firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of whole numbers, the other of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the parts into ſmaller parcels. Their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and value differeth much. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:11804:11"/> parts are written after the maner before named. But the parcels, or the parts of parts called commonly fractions of fractions, are ſet downe by the firſt toward the left hand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any line betweene them for difference ſake, as 5/12 1/3 fiue twelue parts of one third part, 3/4 7/8 three fourth parts, of ſeuen eight parts: or elſe otherwiſe by the prepoſition 5/6 out of 3/10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moreouer, partes are eyther proper or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper. They are leſſe then the vvhole: theſe are eyther equall vnto, or greater then the vvhole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True and proper partes in deede are leſſe then the whole, and therefore that which they ſignifie can not be expreſſed by an vnitie, whereupon they haue the numerator alwaies leſſe then the Denominator. But thoſe parts whoſe Numerator is equall or bigger then the Denominator, are improper partes, for that they may be expreſſed by an whole or mixt number: as 3/3 are as much as one whole: 4/2 are two whole, 6/5 are one whole, and 1/5 more then the whole.</p>
               <p>Wherefore although whole numbers be ſometime ſet downe as partes, yet when the Numeration is once finiſhed, they are neuer written after this manner, but muſt be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to whole numbers: for you cannot fitly ſay, 2/2 two halfes, or 4/3 foure third partes, or 8/4 eight quarters: but one whole, one whole with a third part, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:11804:12"/>

               </p>
               <p>As the framing of an argument is in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke, euen ſo is numeration in this art. For as the Logicians in reaſoning doe inferre the concluſion by the premiſſes, euen ſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticians by numbering doe inferre a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe number from the numbers giuen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The numbers giuen are either of one and the ſelfe ſame kind, as whole numbers, or partes, or of diuerſe kinds as mixt numbers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Numeration of whole numbers is when the numbers giuen are whole numbers.</hi>

                  <hi>And this Numeration is double. Prime: which numbreth one number with an other one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly once, and that eyther by adding or ſubtracting them: whereupon it is called Addition or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if theſe numbers 360. and 15. were giuen either to be added or ſubtracted, you muſt either adde 360. once to 15. or elſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract them once and not many times as in the ſecond numeration. Wherefore this may well be called ſingle numeration, and the other manifold numeration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Addition is a Prime Numeration, which ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning one number to an other, findeth out the totall of the numbers giuen.</hi>

                  <hi>Touching Addition of ſimple figures the rule of reaſon teacheth vs how to doe it, but the addition of compound figures may be learned by this rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If, proceeding orderly from the firſt of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:11804:13"/> numbers giuen to thoſe which folow, you ſet the particular ſummes (being leſſe then ten) of the figures of euery degree added together alone by themſelues, each one vnder his owne degree, putting the ouerplus (that is, for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ten, an vnitie) to the degree following: you ſhall finde out the totall of the numbers gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
               <p>Addition of ſingle nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers may be wrought by the direction of nature only, wherefore it may be practiſed in our mindes, and brought hither for the ſpeedie diſpatching of our worke. As 5 and 6 are 11, 7 and 8 are 15, 9 and 9 are 18. But the Addition of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound numbers goeth on by peecemeale fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> part to part, ſo that it requireth the helpe of art. The firſt precept to be obſerued in this place, is to number all the figures of euerie place alone by themſelues, as though they were but ſingle figures: and this muſt be done in all the partes of Numeration following. The ſeconde is to number the figures of one and the ſame degree onely together, that you confound not the one with the other. Laſt of all, you muſt ſet downe the totall made of the parts, in ſuch ſort, that if they increaſe to ten or more, onely the figure next to the right hand muſt be written vnder that degree, the other which remaineth muſt be added to the degree following. As for example, adde 983. to 402. Firſt, ſetting downe the numbers in ſuch ſort one vnder an other, that the figures
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:11804:13"/> of euery degree may anſwere may anſwere one to an other, I muſt beginne at the firſt and ſay, 2 and 3 are 5, the which I ſet downe vnder that degree: then 0 and 8 are 8, the which I write vnder the ſecond place. Then 4 and 9 are 13, which number for that it is in the laſt place, I ſet it downe whole. So that the totall of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers giuen is, 1385. The example ſtandeth thus.</p>

               <p>In the firſt example euery thing is plaine.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond I beginne to number, 2 from 4 remaine 2, 3 from 3 remaine 0. Then for ſo much as 8 can not be taken from 7, the figure of the ſame degree, I borrow an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the degree following, and ioyne it to 7 thus 17, and drawe 8 out of 17 there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines 9 to be noted vnder neath. This may be done, if (as ſome are wont) I take the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the neather number from 10. &amp; adde it to the vppermoſt number, or ſet downe the vppermoſt number only, if the neathermoſt be 10. As for example, becauſe 8 differeth 2 from 10, I take 2 and adde them to 7 which make 9 to be written vnder the third degree. But for ſo much as I borrowed 1 of 8 in the vppermoſt number following, there remaine but 7, I draw therefore 9 from 17 (taking an vnitie from 5 following) there remaine 8. In the laſt degree, becauſe there is no figure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath which aunſwereth to that aboue, I ſet not downe the whole 5 but 4, becauſe I bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed one of it before.</p>
               <p>In the third example, that the ſignifying figures may be ſubducted out of the cyphers, we muſt borrow of the numbers following an vnitie, as we did before. Firſt take 4 from 5 there remaines 1, then becauſe you cannot take 8 from 6, you muſt ſubtract it from 16, there remaines 8. For although the figures following, from whence I borrow the vnitie, be a cyphar, and therefore without ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:11804:15"/> yet for ſo much as it hath a ſignifying figure before it, I may borrow an vnitie of it. Then I go on and take 9 from 9, there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth nothing. Moreouer I take 1, not from 10, becauſe there was an vnitie borrowed of it before, but from 9, there remaine 8. And for ſo much as there is no figure to be drawen out of that which followeth, I ſet downe 9. Likewiſe I write downe the laſt figure leſſe by one then it is, becauſe I preſuppoſe that it wanteth that vnitie which I tooke from the firſt cyphar.</p>

It maketh no matter which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you make the multiplicande, or which number you make the multiplier, as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the 16. prop. of the ſeuenth Booke of Euclide, which ſayth: If two numbers mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied together, the one into the other, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any numbers, the numbers produced are equall the one to the other: that is, they make one and the ſame number. Notwithſtanding the Scholemen ſet the greateſt number vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt for the multiplicande, and the leaſt neathermoſt for the multiplier, for that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth moſt conuenient for young beginners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Multiplication of ſingle numbers is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in our mindes by this Theoreme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If eyther of the two numbers giuen be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into certaine partes, the product com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the whole numbers multiplied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is equall to the product made by one of the whole numbers and the parts of the other number ſo diuided. The 1. propoſition of the ſecond booke, or elſe, if both the numbers gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen be diuided into certaine parts, that which is made of the whole number, is equall to the product made of their parts.</p>
               <p>That we may multiply eaſily and readily, we muſt haue in our mindes, a table whereby we may know what the pruduct of euery ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple figure is, being multiplied one by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the which thing may be eaſily done by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:11804:16"/> the rule of whole numbers and their partes. Euery child by the direction of nature can tell how many twiſe foure, or foure times fiue, or thriſe ſixe doe make. But if you happen to ſticke in greater numbers, a litle exerciſe will make this table very readie. As if you would knowe how much ſeuen times eight is: di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide eyther of the two numbers giuen, into as many partes as you liſt, as 7. into 2. 3. 2. Then multiply 8. by euery one of theſe parts, and adde the particular productes together, and you ſhall haue 56. How many are eight times 9. diuide 9. into 3. 3. 3. and multiply 8. by thoſe partes, adding the products toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo you ſhall make 72. The ſame may be done if you diuide both the numbers. The examples muſt be ſet downe thus.</p>

               <p>Multiply the ſide A C, by the ſide C D, the product will be the area or platforme of the right angled figure A B C D.

               <p>This definition is taken out of the 39 prop. of the ſeuenth booke of Euclide which ſayth: <hi>If a number meaſure any number, the number meaſured ſhall haue a part of the ſame Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with the number which meaſureth it.

And contrariwiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 8 is the 6 part of 48, therefore 6 diuide 48. Likewiſe if 6 diuide 54, the quotient will be 9, and 9 therefore is the 6 part of 54, and becauſe 9 is the ſixth part of 54, therefore 6 diuide 54, &amp;c.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This is the firſt definition of the 5 and the third def. of the ſeuenth booke. Euclide will not haue euery number that is leſſe then a greater number, to be a part of the greater, but onely that which being taken oftentimes by it ſelfe alone, meaſureth the greater, that is, eyther maketh it, or taketh it cleane away: As two is the third part of 6, fiue is the halfe part often. For that 2 being three times taken, eyther maketh or taketh away 6, and 5 twice take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make 10 or deſtroyeth ten. This kind of part is called commonly, <hi>pars metiens,</hi> or <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurans.</hi> A meaſuring part and of the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous it is called <hi>pars aliquota,</hi> an aliquot part, that is, a quotient: but the number which by it ſelfe alone being oftentimes taken, maketh not a number without the helpe of ſome other part or number, is the parts of the whole, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the worde parts in the plurall number for diſtinction ſake. As 2 are the parts of fiue, becauſe two make not fiue alone, without the helpe of three, or ſome other numbers. This kind of part they commonly call, <hi>pars conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuens,</hi> or <hi>componens:</hi> of the barbarous it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>pars aliquanta.</hi>

                  <hi>Diuiſion of a ſimple quotient may be taken out of the table of Multiplication. For by the ſame numbers that a number is made, by the ſame it may be diuided.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt principle to be obſerued in diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is to conſider wittily, and to know rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:11804:20"/> by what number, and what number eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of the ſingle figures do diuide another, as ſixe times 7 are 42, therefore 7 diuide 42 by 6, and 6 diuide it by 7. Item ſeuen times 9 are 63, therefore 9 diuide 63, and the quotient is 7, or 7 diuide it, and the quotient is 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The diuiſion of a number that hath many fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, is wrought by the Theoreme follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If, beginning at the laſt figure of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers giuen, you multiply the particular quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of the diuiſor contayned in the diuidend (ſetting it downe aſide by it ſelfe) into the Diuiſor, and then ſubtract the product from the diuidend, doing this as often as may be, by ſetting forwarde the Diuiſor towarde the right hand, till you come to the firſt figure of the diuidend, the quotient of the parts will be the quotient of the numbers giuen.</p>
               <p>Although diuiſion commonly be wrought by finding out the quotient by multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; ſubduction: yet the principall worke wherein the whole force or vertue of diuiſion conſiſteth, is onely the finding out of the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, which being once found, the diuiſion in minde is ſuppoſed to be done. But when we haue found out the quotient, we are to thinke and conſider with our ſelues into how many partes the diuiſor cutteth the number which is ſet ouer it, and how often it may be drawen out of it. That this therefore may be ſet before our eyes, and that in remouing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:11804:20"/> forward the Diuiſor, the remainder (wherein afterwarde the quotient muſt be ſought for) may more manifeſtly appeare, the truth of that which we conceiued before, is proued by multiplication and ſubtraction.</p>
               <p>To expreſſe this by examples, diuide 4936 by 4, we muſt ſeeke how often the Diuiſor 4 being ſet vnder the laſt figure of the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend, is contayned in the ſame. I ſay then that 4 is contayned in 4 once: wherefore I ſet downe 1 in the quotient, and take 4 out of 4, there remaines nothing. Then ſet I the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſor one degree forwarde towarde the right hand, where 4 are contayned in 9 twice: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I note 2 in the quotient, and multiply the Diuiſor by it, the product is 8, which being ſubducted from 9, there remaine 1. The figures out of which the ſubtraction is made, muſt ſtraight way be blotted out. Againe ſet forwarde the diuiſor: there 4 may be taken from 13 three times, wherefore I ſet 3 in the quotient, and multiply 4 by it, the product is 12, which being drawen out of 13, there remaines 1. To conclude, I find 4 in 16 foure times, therefore I ſet downe 4 for the quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and multiply 4 by it, which being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of 16, there is nothing left. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>

               <p>Againe deuide 1008 by 36. In this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there be many things to be taken heede of. Firſt, becauſe the laſt figure of the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend is leſſe then the laſt of the Diuiſor, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſet not 2 vnder 1, but one place farther towarde the right hande vnder the o. And firſt I conſider with my ſefe, how often three may be had in ten, I find it to be thriſe, and there remaineth one. But for ſo much as I cannot ſubduct the Product made by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the quotient into the whole diuiſor, out of the number ſtanding aboue it, to wit, 108 out of 100, therefore I take a quotient leſſe then that by one, that is 2, whereby the diuiſor being multiplied, there ariſe 72, which being taken out of 100, there remaine 28 to be written ouer the head. Then the diuiſor being ſet forward, I ſee three to be contained in 28 nine times, but becauſe I muſt haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard alſo of the figure following, I ſet but 8 in the quotient, which being multiplied into the diuiſor, make 288 to be drawen out of the number ſet ouer it. The example is thus.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:11804:21"/>
               <p>It appeareth therefore by this, that the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion muſt be made not of the whole Diuiſor, vnleſſe it be a ſingle number, but only of the laſt figure of the Diuiſor, and euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar muſt be but a ſingle figure, as if you ſhold ſeeke how often 2 were in 21, you can not take it tenne times, but 9 times, but 9 times at the moſt. Moreouer the nature of the thing requireth that we find out alwayes ſuch a quotient, as being multiplied by the Diuiſor, maketh no greater a number then the diuidend is. See the examples following.</p>

               <p>If the Diuiſor end in cyphers, the worke may be wrought by the ſignifying figures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſetting the cyphers in the meane time, vnder the vtmoſt figures of the diuidend, next to the right hand. But if the laſt figure of the Diuiſor be an vnitie, and the reſt cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, then ſetting the Diuiſor as before, and

                  <hi>NVmbers are diuided two manner of wayes, firſt into euen and odde numbers. An euen number is that which may be diuided by 2. An odde number is that vvhich can not be diuided by 2.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the 6 &amp; 7 definition of the ſeuenth booke of Euclide, whence this difference of numbers drawen out of their diuiſion, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as that alſo which followeth, whoſe vſe in Arithmeticke is very great. Euen numbers are as theſe following, 2. 4. 6. 8. 10. 12. 14. and ſo forth after the ſame order, alwaies omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one. Odde numbers are, as 3. 5. 7. 9. 11. 13. 15. &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Of euen numbers ſome may be diuided but one way onely, other ſome may be diuided many waies. Thoſe which may be diuided but one way onely, are euenly euen, or oddely euen.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A number euenly euen, is that vvhich an euen number diuideth by an euen number.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the eight definition of the ſeuenth, ſuch are 4. 8. 16. 32. 64. &amp;c. that is to ſay, all the numbers from 2 vpward doubled by 2. As appeareth by the 32 prop. of the 9 booke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A number odly euen, is that vvhich an odde number meaſureth by an euen number.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As it is in the 9 definition of the ſeuenth booke. Euclide calleth it an euenly odde nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as 6. 10. 14. 18. 22. For 3 an odde number diuideth 6 by 2 an euen nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber: 5 an odde nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diuideth 10. by 2 an euen nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber. Such are all the numbers whoſe moytie or halfe is an
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:11804:23"/> odde number, as appeareth by the 33 prop. of the ſeuenth booke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The numbers vvhich may be diuided manie vvayes, are euenly euen and odde: which may be diuided both by an euen number, and by an odde, into an euen number.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This third kind of numbers, is let paſſe of Euclide among the definitions of the ſeuenth booke, but yet not neglected in the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ninth booke. The examples ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are theſe, 12. 20. 24. 28. 56. 144. As 2 an euen number diuideth 12 by 6 an euen num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and 3 an odde number diuideth it by 4 an euen number. Item 2 an euen number di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth 20 into 10 an euen number: and 5 an odde number diuideth it into 4 an eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Such are all thoſe numbers which are neither doubled by two from 2 vpward, nor haue their halfe an odde number as it is in the 34. prop. of the 9 booke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Againe, numbers be diſtinguiſhed otherwaies being conſidered both by themſelues, and one with another. Being conſidered by themſelues, they are eyther prime, vvhich may be diuided by an vnitie onely: or compound, vvhich may be diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſome other number.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the 12 and 13 definition of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth booke, where Euclide diuideth num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers into prime &amp; compound numbers. The matter of this diuiſion is taken out of the 34 prop of the ſeuenth booke, which ſayth: <hi>That euery number is eyther a prime number, or elſe</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:11804:24"/> diuided by a prime number: that is, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound number, as appeareth by the 33 prop. of the ſame booke. A prime number is that which no other number diuideth beſides an vnitie, ſauing that it meaſureth it ſelfe. It may be called an vncompound number for that it is made of no number: as 2. 3. 5. 7. 11. 13. &amp;c. A compound number is that which ſome other number maketh, being taken certaine times, as 4. 6. 10. 12. Of this ſort are firſt of all, all euen numbers, then all thoſe odde numbers which in the eleuenth definition of the ſeuenth booke are called oddely odde: which may be diuided by an odde number into an odde number, as 9. 15. 21. 25. 27. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Numbers compared one with an other, ſome are Prime in reſpect one of an other, vvhich can not commonly be diuided by any other number, but by an vnitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Other ſome are compound in reſpect one of an other, vvhich may be commonly diuided by one or moe numbers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This difference of numbers compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, is drawen out of the former, and is ſet downe in the twelfth and eleuenth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of the ſeuenth booke. Numbers prime in reſpect one of another, haue no common diuiſor beſide an vnitie, which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureth all numbers: As 3 and 8, 6 and 7, 5 and 12. Therefore when the numbers giuen are prime one to an other, there can no leſſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:11804:24"/> numbers be giuen in the ſame proportions. So that prime numbers are the leaſt, and the leaſt are prime numbers, as appeareth in the twentie and twentie foure propoſition of the ſeuenth booke. And therefore, when the numbers giuen are prime, they are alſo the termes of the proportion giuen, as we ſhall ſee afterward. Compound numbers in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect one of an other, may commonly be diuided by one, or many numbers, as 3 and 9, 9 and 15: for 3 is the common Diuiſor of them both. Item 12, 18, 24, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly diuided not onely by 6, but alſo by 3 and 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If you vvould knowe vvhether the numbers giuen, be prime or compounde one to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you may doe it by the Theoreme follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two vnequall numbers being giuen, if in ſubducting the leſſe from the greater as often as may be, the remainder diuideth not that which went before it, vntill it come to an vnitie, the numbers giuen are prime one to an other. 1. prop. 7.</p>
               <p>As in 4 and 11, 18 and 7, 35 and 12, in ſubducting the one from the other continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, you ſhall come to an vnitie: wherefore I ſay, that they be prime in reſpect one of an other.</p>

                  <hi>HItherto we haue ſpoken of the numeration of vvhole numbers: now followeth the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of parts, wherein the numbers giuen are onely parts. And it is alſo double, Accident all and Eſſentiall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Accidentall numeration is that which by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction chaungeth the forme and faſhion of the parts, chaunging their value nothing at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This numeration in one word is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called reduction, where the parts are ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that they only take vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another ſhape, ſuch an one as is fitteſt for the worke enſuing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reduction is double: the one is of parts vnto parts, the other of parts vnto whole numbers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reduction of parts vnto parts, is that vvhich findeth out other parts proportionable to the parts giuen, by reducing them either to leſſe termes or to termes of one denomination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reduction of parts to leſſe termes, is that which diuideth the termes of the partes giuen (being compound numbers one to another) by their greateſt common diuiſor: and taketh their quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients in ſtead of their numbers giuen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing that parts haue their value onely of the proportion that is betweene the vpper number and the neathermoſt, and euery pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion is beſt knowen when it is ſet downe in leaſt termes: therefore in the partes alſo it ſhall not be amiſſe to reduce them which are written in greater termes (that is, with num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers compound one to an other) or leſſer
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:11804:30"/> termes, the which thing is done by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diuiſor. For the quotients haue the ſame proportion that the numbers diuided haue, as appeareth by the 35 prop. 7. So that their value is not chaunged.</p>
               <p>The proofe alſo of this may be taken out of the 17 prop. 7. which ſaieth, <hi>If a number multiply two other numbers, the products ſhall haue the ſame proportion that the multipliers haue.</hi> Contrariwiſe therefore if a number di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide other two numbers, the quotients and the numbers diuided ſhall haue one propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the one to the other. As if 4 multiply 6 and 8, their products 24 and 32 ſhall haue the ſame proportion which the numbers gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen haue. Againe, if you diuide theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts 24 and 32 by 4, the ſame numbers to wit, 6 and 8 will returne againe in the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. If the parts giuen therefore be 6/21 they muſt not be ſet downe in theſe termes, but muſt be reduced ſtraight wayes to 2/7. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe 4/16 diuided by 4, come to 1/4. So 108/252 may be reduced by 36 their greateſt common di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſor to 3/7.</p>
               <p>By this kinde of Reduction not onely the termes of the ſame partes, but alſo the termes of diuerſe parts may be reduced croſſewayes one by an other: that is, the numerator of the one, and the denominator of the other. As 2/3 and 5/8 their termes being reduced croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes will be 2/3 5/4.</p>
               <p>But this rule concerning the Reduction
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:11804:31"/> of diuerſe partes, is not ſo generall as the other of one and the ſame parts. For it is more ſpeciall and peculiar, as it were to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication, as we ſhall ſee hereafter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt not thinke that all ſuch partes giuen may be reduced after this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reduction of parts to one denomination is that, vvhich (vvhen the parts giuen are of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe denomitations) taketh firſt the leaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber vvhich may be diuided by the denominators, for the common Denominator, and then diuiding that number by the denominators of the parts gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, ſetteth down the products made by the quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, &amp; by the numerators of the parts giuen for the numerators of the partswhich vve ſeeke for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a thing of great vſe to reduce the partes giuen to one denomination, and to make them proportionable one to an other in the leaſt termes that may be: that is; of partes of diuerſe kindes, to make partes of one and the ſame kind. As for example if 3/4 and 5/6 were to be brought to one denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I muſt firſt ſeeke out the leaſt number that may be diuided by 4 and 6, which is 12, then I diuide 12 by their denominators 4 and 6, and multiply 3 and 5 the numerators of the parts giuen by the quotients 3 and 2, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts 9 and 10 ſhall be the numerators of the parts ſought out: and the leaſt number which might be diuided by the denominators: to wit, 12, ſhall be the common denominator to them both. As in this example.</p>

               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:11804:32"/>
               <p>In the firſt example therefore, the parts of one denomination are 9/12 10/12, and they be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the leaſt proportionable to the parts gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. For as in 3/4 4 is to 12, ſo is 3 to 9: and in 5/6 as 6 is to 12, ſo is 5 to 10, and ſo forth in the other examples.</p>
               <p>By this rule of reduction we may knowe whether the parts being of diuers denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be equal or vnequall. For being brought to one denomination, if they haue the ſame numerators they be equall: if not, they be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall: they that haue the greateſt numerator are the greateſt, and they that haue the leaſt numerator are the leſſe. As if it ſhould fall into queſtion what proportion there were betwene 5/6 and 10/12. Item betwene 5/7 and 13/21, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be equall or vnequall, this rule will take away the doubt: and will declare that the former parts are equal, the latter vnequal, and 5/7 to be the greater, 13/21 the leſſer, as you ſee here.</p>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:11804:32"/> the reduction of parts to vvhole numbers, and it is either of proper or improper parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt reduction of proper parts taketh the numerators of many partes, hauing one denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for the parts giuen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As 3/5 and 4/5 are reduced to whole numbers when the numerators of the partes giuen 3 and 4, being as it were proportionable to the parts giuen, are taken for the parts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: ſo likewiſe we reduce theſe partes 1/9 4/9 7/9 to whole numbers, when we take 1, 4, 7, the numerators for the parts themſelues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reduction of improper parts taketh the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of the numerator diuided by the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, for the parts giuen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This reduction is vſed when the partes are but one, and their value either equall or greater then the whole, as 3/3 10/5 27/9. If you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the numerators of euery part ſeuerally by his denominator, the quotients will be 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Hitherto alſo may thoſe parts be referred whoſe denominators doe not exactly diuide the numerators, as 36/7 are reduced to 5 1/7 and 29/6 to 4 5/6.</p>

               <p>Partes of diuerſe denominations the one being greater or leſſe then the other, can not be added together without confounding of the denominators, wherefore it is needfull to reduce them to one denomination. As if you adde 3/5 to 4/5 the totall will be 7/5, or by reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 1 2/5. Item adde 3/4 to 5/8, here if you ſhould confound 4 with 8, the totall ſhould haue his denominator of neither of them both.

                  <hi>Thus much of the firſt kind of the Eſſentiall numeration of parts: the ſecond kinde giueth to the numerator found out an other denominator then the parts haue vvhich are giuen. And it is either Multiplication or Diuiſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Multiplication is that vvhich multiplying the termes of one kinde together (that is the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merators by the numerators, and the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators by the denominators) taketh the products for the termes of the parts found out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This multiplication is properly the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of other parts then are giuen, which are to one of the partes giuen, as the other is to an vnitie: and it is wrought by multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both the numerators and the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the parts giuen one by an other, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may neceſſarily conclude, that the partes found out are alwayes leſſe then the parts multiplyed. As if there were 1/2 to be multiplyed by 1/3, multiplying the numerators and the denominators one by the other, the product is 1/6, which is to 1/3, as 1/2 is to 1. For as 1/2 is the halfe of one, ſo 1/6 is the halfe of 1/3, wherefore 1/6 is leſſe then 1/3 or 1/2. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes may be perceiued more eaſily in the numbring of ſome certaine thing. As for example, in a degree there be 60 minutes, therefore 1/2 of a degree are 30 minutes, 1/3 20 minutes, 1/6 10 minutes: as therefore 60 are to 30, ſo are 20 to 10. Againe in a ſhilling there are twelue pence, therefore 1/2 of a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling are ſixe pence, 1/3 foure pence, 1/6 2 pence:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:11804:34" rendition="simple:additions"/> as therefore a ſhilling is to ſixe pence, ſo are foure pence to two pence. Item if 5/7 be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied by 3/4 the product will be 15/28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The abridgement of multiplication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the oppoſite termes of the partes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen be numbers compound one to an other, then in their ſtead take their quotients found out by their greateſt common diuiſor: and then worke the multiplication as before.</p>
               <p>As, multiply 3/4 by 5/18. Here for ſo much as 3 and 18 being oppoſite termes, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound one to another, you ſhall ſet downe in their ſtead their quotients 1 and 6 found out by their common Diuiſor, ſo that the parts thus reduced ſhall be 1/4 and 5/6. Now multiplying 1 by 5, and 4 by 6, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct will be 5/24. Likewiſe if 3/7 ſhould be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed by 14/15, firſt you muſt reduce them to 1/1 and 2/5, which being multiplied one by the other, make 2/5. As in theſe examples.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Of this reduction of numbers this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is gathered. If the croſſe or oppoſite termes of many parts be equall one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then neglecting them which are equall, the numerator remayning ſet ouer the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minator remaining, is the product of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:11804:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>As if 4/5 5/6 6/7 7/8, were to be multiplied to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, I caſt away the middle numbers which are equall, and ſee 4 the numerator o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer 8 the denominator, ſo that the product is 4/8 or by reduction 1/2. The reaſon hereof is this, becauſe the croſſe termes being as it were compound one to the other, are by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to one denominator brought to vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thus, 4/1 1/1 1/1 1/8. But for ſo much as an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in multiplication chaungeth not a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, therefore the figure 4 multiplied by the three vnities in the ſame ranke, maketh but 4, no more doth 8.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it appeareth by this proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is in multiplication, that ſeconde parts may well be reduced to principall parts by this meanes, as 1/3 out of 3/4 are 3/12 or 1/4 of the whole, which thing may be eaſily perceiued in the numbring of any thing, as 3/4 of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree are 45 minutes, whoſe third part are 15 minutes, which are equall to 1/4 of a degree. So 2/3 of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>/4 parts of a crowne are halfe a crowne. For 3/4 are three ſhillings nine pence, whoſe 2/3 parts are two ſhillings ſixe pence. So 5/6 1/2 of 3/8 by multiplication are brought to 15/96 or 5/32. And thus much of multiplication of parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diuiſion is that vvhich in ſtead of the partes giuen diuideth vvhole numbers proportionable vnto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The diuiſion of parts is properly the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a quotient which is in proportion to the diuidend, as an vnitie is to the diuiſor.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:11804:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> Whereby it is manifeſt, that the quotient muſt needes be greater then the parts which are diuided, otherwiſe then it is in diuiſion of whole numbers: for there the quotient is alwayes leſſe then the diuidend. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention commeth of the diuiſion of ſuch numbers as are proportionable to the parts giuen, for ſo much as the partes themſelues can not be diuided.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore diuide theſe partes of one denomination, to wit, 9/10 by 3/10. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhall reduce them (by the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to whole numbers) vnto 9 and 3, then ſhall you diuide 9 by 3, the quotient will be 3, which declareth that 3/10 the diuiſor is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in 9/10, the diuidend three times, and as 3/10 are to one, ſo are 9/10 to three: the which quotient therefore is bigger then the partes diuided.</p>
               <p>Diuided 5/6 by 3/6, that is, ſee how many times 3/6 are contayned in 5/6. Firſt you ſhall reduce the partes giuen to whole numbers propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable vnto them, that is, to 5 and 3, then ſhall you diuide 5 by 3, the quotient will be 1 2/3. Contrariwiſe, 3/6 diuided by 5/6 giue in the quotient 3/5. For both the denominators be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neglected, I ſet the one numerator ouer the other as parts, becauſe the one cannot be diuided by the other.</p>
               <p>Furthermore if you diuide parts of diuerſe denominations, as 3/4 by 1/3, you ſhall firſt make the partes of one denomination, reducing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:11804:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> them to 9/12 and 4/12: then by the former redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction you ſhall bring them to whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and diuide 9 by 4, the quotient will be 2 1/4. Diuide 8/9 by 5/6, reduce the partes to one denomination, that is, to 16/18 and 13/18, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce theſe partes hauing one denomination to whole numbers 16 and 15, which being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided one by another, make in their quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent 1 1/15.</p>

               <p>In writing of proportions the numbers whereby they are expreſſed, are by a Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall phraſe called terms: by which word are to be vnderſtood ſuch quantities as are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together. Hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> generally ſuch things as are compared together are called Termes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paring of termes together, is called Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, which is a certain reſpect which the terms haue one to another according to their quantitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This definition in this place is more general then the 3 def. of the 5 book of Euclide, which faith, that <hi>Proportion is a certaine reſpect of two magnitudes of one kinde onely, according to their quantitie.</hi> For in that place it was requiſit that there ſhold be mention made of magnitudes of one kind only, becauſe that magnitudes are not al of one kind. But here thoſe words may be omitted, becauſe al nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers are of one kind, &amp; euery one may be compared together: and moreouer the analogie or reſpect which they haue one to another, may be expreſſed by an other number, which thing cannot be done in all magnitudes, though they be all of one kind itrationall, and ſurde magnitudes can not be expreſſed by number.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The compariſon of termes, is either equall or vnequall, whereupon it is called Proportion of equalitie or vnequalitie.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Proportion of equalitie is one only, and not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into many kinds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the proportion of 5 to 5, of 6 to 6, of 12 to 12. For both in theſe, and in all other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall termes, the reſpect is all one, neither hath it any more kindes, becauſe that one and the ſame number cannot be either more or leſſe equall to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proportion of inequality is knowne either by the difference of the termes, or by their quotient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The proportion of difference, is that whereby one terme differeth from another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The proportion of the quotient is vvhen one terme contayneth another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The proportion of difference is known by ſubduction, the proportion of the quotient is knowne by diuiſion.</p>
               <p>As in the naturall order of the numbers the difference betwene 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, 4 and 5, 5 and 6, &amp;c. is all one, that is an vnitie. Againe, the difference betweene 8 and 5 is 3, betweene 6 and 4 it is 2. But the proportion of the quotient is by an eſpeciall phraſe ſimply called proportion. As, the proportion of 2 to 1 is double, of 3 to 2 ſeſquialter, of 24 to 3 octuple. For the former termes (which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly are called the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents) being diuided by the termes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (which are called the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequents) the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients are 1, 1 1/2, 8: whereby we may gather that there may be now and then the ſame diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwene the termes though as touching
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:11804:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> the quotient their proportion differ, as in 4 8 and 12, the difference betwene 4 and 8, and betwene 8 and 12, is all one, yet the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gathered by their quotients is diuerſe, for in the one it is 2, double, in the other it is but ſeſquialter 1 1/2. Contrariwiſe alſo in termes the proportion of the quotient may be all one, though their difference be diuerſe: as in 3 and 9, 4 and 12, the quotient is 3 triple in them both: yet the difference is not a like, for in the former it is 6, in the ſecond it is 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>portion of inequalitie is double, for either the greater terme is antecedent to the leſſe, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent. Hereupon the one is called the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the greater inequalitie, the other the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the leſſer inequalitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When two termes are compared together, the one is called the Antecedent, the other the conſequent. Therefore, as often as the greater terme is the antecedent and goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is called the greater inequalitie. As when 6 is compared to 3, and 3 to 2. But if the leſſer terme be the Antecedent, and we conſider what difference there is betweene that and the greater, it is called the leſſer ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Both theſe fornamed proportions are either Prime or Seconde.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>As when 3 is compared to 2, 6 to 5, 8 to 7. For in theſe proportions the antecedent contayneth the conſequent once, and one part beſide of the leſſer terme. As it may be perceiued by their quotients when they be diuided thus, 1 1/2, 1 1/5, 1 1/7. This kinde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth vnder it infinite other kindes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the firſt is ſeſquialter, the ſecond ſeſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertia, the fourth ſeſquiquarta.</p>
               <p>Item there is the ſame proportion betwene 12 and 8, that is betwene 15 and 10, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by their termes reduced to the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination thus, 1 1/2.</p>

For the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents being diuided by the conſequents, their quotients declare their proportion on this manner, 1 2/3, 1 3/4, 1 5/8. Likewiſe the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwene 15 and 9 is ſuperpartiens, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the quotient and the parts redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the leaſt denomination. 1 2/3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Multiplex is a prime proportion vvhen the greater terme contayneth the leſſe certaine times exactly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Multiplex is defined after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:11804:42" rendition="simple:additions"/> in the ſecond defin. of the fifth booke of Euclide, which ſaith, that <hi>Multiplex is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quantitie in reſpect of a leſſe, when the leſſe meaſureth the greater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the proportions of 4 to 2, 9 to 3, 16 to 4 are multiplices, that is to ſay, double, triple, quadruple: for their quotients are 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second proportion conſiſteth of two kindes of proportion, and is either multiplex ſuperparticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris, or multiplex ſuperpartiens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeemeth that theſe kinds of proportions are made of the former, by ioyning two of their names together. For the one is the third kinde of proportion ioyned to the firſt, and the other is the third ioyned to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Multiplex ſuperparticular is is a compound proportion, wherein one terme contayneth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther certaine times, and one part beſides.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Here we are to vnderſtande, that they be the true partes which are not equall to the leſſer terme, as in 11 to 4, 12 to 5, 22 to 6. For the quotients are 2 3/4, 2 2/3, 3 2/3.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Notation is the writing of the antecedents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, and the conſequents beneath.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The proportions being written, are expreſſed by the quotient (the parts if there be any, being reduced to the leaſt termes) which declareth as well their proportion as their denomination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In multiplex proportion it is called dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, triple, quadruple, octuple proportion, where the quotients are 2, 3, 4, 8. In propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of leſſer inequalitie this prepoſition <hi>Sub</hi> is generally added in them all. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, it is called in Submultiplex, Subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Subtriple, Subquadruple, &amp;c. In Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>particular proportion (becauſe the halfe of the greater number is the proportion) it is called after the manner of the Latines <hi>Seſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altera, Seſquitertia, &amp;c.</hi> putting the worde <hi>Sequi</hi> in the beginning, and the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the partes in the ending as when the quotients are 1 1/2, 1 1/3, 1 1/4. In proportions of the leſſer inequalitie we ſay, <hi>Subſeſquialte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, Subſeſquitertia, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:11804:43"/>
               <p>Likewiſe Submultiplex, Superparticular, Submultiplex Superpartiens. For in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound proportions the names are alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, as in 3 1/1 triple ſeſquiquarta, 2 4/4 dupla ſuperquadripartiens, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And thus much for inſtruction ſake. For I know that theſe wordes are very ſtraunge to vs, and not heard of, nor vſed among the beſt writers. For they when they would ſpeake of the proportions of things, were wont to expreſſe them by two numbers. As Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes in expreſſing the proportion of the circumference of a circle to the Diameter, ſayd not that it was triple ſeſquitertia, but as 22 was to 7.</p>
               <p>Moreouer the quotients teach vs the way not onely how to expreſſe the proportions giuen, but alſo how to ſet them downe in the leaſt termes. For if you ſet an vnitie vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, or ouer againſt the quotients being whole numbers, you ſhall find out the leaſt termes of the multiplex which you ſeeke for. As in the multiplices, if you ſet an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie right againſt 3, 4, 5, the proportion in the leaſt termes will be triple, quadruple, quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuple. Againe, if you reduce the quotients being mixt numbers, by the ſeconde redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of mixt numbers vnto partes, you ſhall in like manner finde out the leaſt termes in the other kind of proportions: as in Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>particular proportion, if you ſeeke for the leaſt termes of 1 1/2 ſeſquialtera, 1 1/3 ſeſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertia,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:11804:43"/> 1 1/8 ſeſquioctaua, then the quotients reduced after the foreſaide manner, the leaſt termes will be theſe.</p>

               <p>

                  <hi>Proportion is the equalitie of reaſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Euclide in the fourth definition of the fifth booke, defineth proportion to bee a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of reaſons. Ariſtotle in the fifth booke and 3. Chapter of the Ethickes, calleth it an equalitie of reaſons. If wee ſhoulde define it to be the Identitie of reaſons, we ſhould not varie much from the meaning of Euclide, who in the ſixth definition of the fifth booke ſpeaketh after the ſame manner, calling them <hi>proportionall quantities vvhich haue the ſame reaſon one to another.</hi> And albeit that theſe definitions doe properly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to Geometricall proportion, yet if you take the word reaſon in the largeſt ſenſe, for any kinde of reſpect it ſhall be generall, ſo that as reaſon or proportionalitie is a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall reſpect of two termes one to another, ſo proportion ſhall be a reſpect of like termes one to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proportion is either Arithmeticall or Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arithmeticall proportion is an equalitie of differences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As in 8, 7, 6, and in 12, 9, 6, 3. Here are two proportions, wherein you may ſee an equalitie of differences, or an equall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:11804:46"/> of the antecedents. In the firſt, the difference is 1, in the latter it is 3. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in 15, 11: 8, 4, as 15 exceede 11 by 4, ſo 8 exceede 4 by 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arithmeticall proportion is double, for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is continued in the termes, or it is ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, vvhereupon it is called continuall, or diſiunct proportion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe differences are common both to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticall, and to Geometricall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That proportion is continuall where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not onely the extremes are continued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by one meane, but generally euerie proportion, wherein many and ſundrie middle termes haue a continuall reſpect one to another, ſo that any of them may be ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the antecedent or the conſequent. In ſo much, that not onely the proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene 3, 2, 1 is continuall: where 2 is the conſequent of the former, and the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the latter proportion: but this alſo 5, 7, 9, 11, where the ſame difference is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from the firſt to the laſt. And any of the middle numbers either 7 or 9, haue the ſame nature in reſpect of them that goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and follow after, that 2 had in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer example.</p>
               <p>Proportion is ſeuered in the termes when the firſt onely hath the ſame reſpect to the ſecond, that the third hath to the fourth, but the ſecond agreeth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionablie with the thirde: that is,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:11804:47"/> when all the termes in order as they followe are not of like proportion one to the other. As 10, 8, 4, 2, are ſeuerally proportionall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 2 the firſt difference is not continued betwene 8 and 4. So that here is a ſeuering not onely of the termes, but alſo of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions. Leauing therefore in this place to ſpeake of diſiunct proportion, wee will han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle that which is continuall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Continuall proportion is either Simple, where the extreames haue but one middle terme: or manifold, vvherein many middle termes go on in order continually: vvhereupon it is called progreſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Progreſſion is a continuall enlarging of the termes of the proportion giuen: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there are two extreames giuen, and manie other numbers in the middle betwene them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In Arithmeticall progreſſion we are to finde out two things, either the number of the termes as they ſtand in order, or elſe their ſumme.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Sometimes the termes be all ſought for as they follow in order, and are found out by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all adding of the difference to the laſt terme in the progreſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if you would know the termes of this progreſſion 1, 5, 9, 13, as they follow in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, you muſt adde 4, which is the difference vnto 13, then the fifth terme will be 17, to which if you adde 4 againe, it maketh 21, which is the ſixth terme, and ſo foorth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sometime breaking off their naturall order, we ſeeke for ſome one terme in the progreſſion, which may be found out by the Theoreme following.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The progreſſion increaſing, if you take an vnitie from the name of the terme which you ſeeke for, &amp; adde the product made of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, and the common difference of the termes, vnto the firſt terme, the totall will be that which you deſire. The progreſſion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, if that product be taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt terme the remainder is the terme ſought for.</p>
               <p>As in this progreſſion 4, 7, 10, where the difference is 3, I deſire to know the 12 terme beginning at 4. Here 12 is the name of the terme which I ſeeke for, from whence I take 1, and multiply 11 which remaine by 3 the difference, the product is 33, whereto I adde 4 the firſt terme. So the totall is 37 the terme which I ſought for. Likewiſe the 30 terme is 91, and ſo foorth.

                  <hi>Thus much for the finding out of the termes. The finding out of the ſumme is the halfe of the product made by multiplying the two extremes added together, and the name of the laſt terme, as it ſtandeth in order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As in this example, 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, both the extreames added together make 22, the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:11804:48"/> name of the laſt terme is 6, for it is the ſixt in order. Whereby if you multiply 22, the product will be 132, the halfe whereof (that is) 66, is the ſumme ſought for.</p>
               <p>This rule may be proued by the 41 prop. of the firſt booke of Euclide, which ſaith, <hi>If a parallelogramme and a triangle haue one and the ſelfe ſame baſe, and be in the ſame altitude, the parallelogramme ſhall be double to the trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle.</hi> The numbers then of the progreſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the triangle: whereof one ſide is the name of the laſt terme, or (as they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terme it) the number of the places: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the extremes added together. But for ſo much as the product made of theſe two ſides maketh not a triangle, but a parallelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gramme, therefore in taking the one halfe I gather by it how bigge the platforme of the triangle is, which is the ſumme of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</p>

                  <hi>Geometricall proportion is double: Diſiunct, or Continuall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diſiunct is that, that agreeth neither in termes nor proportionalitie, or reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As in 6, 3, 16, 8, for here are two double proportions diſtinquiſhed both in termes and in reaſon, becauſe that betweene 3 and 16 there is not the ſame reaſon obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that is betwene 6 and 3 and betweene 16 and 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diſiunct proportion conſiſteth of foure termes at the leaſt. It hath this propertie that the product of the extremes, is equall to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct made of the middle numbers, and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. 16. p. 6. &amp; 19. p. 7.</hi>

               <p>Among the properties of Geometricall proportion ſet foorth by Euclide, this is moſt excellent and neceſſarie to be knowne, becauſe the force and fruitfulneſſe thereof is ſuch, that it may very well be called the head of cyphering, that is, the foundation and off-ſpring of all rules, as we ſhall ſee hereafter. It hath this meaning, that the number made by multiplying of the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fourth, is equall to the number made by multiplying the ſeconde into the thirde, as in 6, 4, 18, 12, the product made of 6, multiplyed by 12 is 72, the which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ariſeth by multiplying the middle num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers 4 and 18 one by another. And this thing is proper to continuall, and generally to all Geometricall proportion, as wee ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This propertie miniſtreth vnto vs the golden Rule, vvhich three proportionall numbers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing giuen, diuiding the product made by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the third into the ſecond by that vvhich remaineth, findeth out the fourth proportionall number.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of the fore named propertie, as out of a moſt plentifull ſpring is drawen this Rule, wherein conſiſteth the chiefeſt partes of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting accounts. The which ſome for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of it doe call the Rule, others the rule of Proportion, other the rule of three, and all men all moſt in generall, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vſe of it, doe call it the golden Rule.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:11804:50"/> The drift and end of it, is the finding out of a fourth terme, or number, that ſhall haue the ſame proportion with the three numbers gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: the which thing it bringeth to paſſe by multiplying two termes of the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions giuen one by the other, that is, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent of the one, and the conſequent of the other, and diuiding the product by the other which remaineth: for the quotient will be the fourth number of the proportion giuen.</p>
               <p>As in 3, 2, 9, I deſire to knowe the fourth that ſhall be to 9, as 2 to 3, multiply there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 2 by 9, and diuide 18 the product by 3 which remaineth, the quotient will be 6, the proportionall number which was ſought for.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of this conſequence is manifeſt, becauſe hauing the product of the middle numbers, it is all one as if you ſhould ſay, that you had the product made of the firſt and fourth numbers, and to proue that, or to bring to light the fourth number lying hidde in the product, you muſt diuide the product by the firſt number, and ſay, that the quotient is the other number vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen which made the diuidend: becauſe that euerie number is diuided by thoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers by which it is made, and euery pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct diuided by one of the multiplicators bringeth forth the other.</p>
               <p>As in 9, 6, 12, I deſire to finde the fourth, multiply therefore 6 by 12, that is the middle
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:11804:51"/> number, then I ſay, the product 72 is the product ariſing of 9, and the fourth number vnknowen. The product then being had, and one of the multipliers knowen, the other cannot any longer be hid. Wherefore I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide 72 by 9 the quotient will be 8, which is the other multiplier, and alſo the fourth number in proportion: thus, 9, 6, 12, 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This rule is vſed in proportion ſimple or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifolde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simple proportion is that which conſiſteth onely of foure termes or numbers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The forme vvhereof is double, for either the proportion proceedeth directly forward, or elſe backewarde, vvherevpon it is called Direct, or Reciprocall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I call that Direct proportion, vvherein as the firſt terme is to the ſecond, ſo the third is to the fourth, and croſſewayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which is Direct proportion, may be eaſily gathered by this, that by howe much the third number is greater or leſſe, by ſo much the fourth in order-ſhall be greater or leſſe, whether the numbers be giuen ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, or croſſewaies, or backwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it is handled two manner of wayes, for ſometimes beſides the ordering of the terms there is nothing elſe required: ſometimes it requireth ſome former kind of numeration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ordering or diſpoſing of the termes to conclude the proportion attributeth to euery one that is giuen his owne place: that is, to the thing</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:11804:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                  <hi>vvhich is called into queſtion, it giueth the third place: the firſt place to the thing of the ſame kind: the middle place to that vvhich remaineth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The lawfull order of the termes is that in diſtinguiſhing the reaſons, we ioyne the conſequent of euery reaſon to his owne antecedent of the ſame kind. As if I ſhould ſay, ſeeing Iupiter in foure moneths moueth tenne degrees in the Zodiacke: therefore in ſixe monethes it moueth 15 degrees. Here the proportion ordinarily ſhall ſtand thus, 4, 6, 10, 15. For as 4 monethes is to 6 monethes, ſo is 10 degrees vnto 15 degrees. For here alſo the product made of the extreames is equall to the product made of the middle numbers.</p>
               <p>But the termes in the Rule of proportions is otherwiſe ordered, becauſe in things of one kind the queſtion is not ſo moued, that they ſhould be ioyned together, but croſſewayes. For we doe not moue the queſtion cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly from the antecedent of the ſecond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to his conſequent thus, if 4 moneths are 6 monethes, what are tenne degrees? But the queſtion is moued from the conſequent of the firſt reaſon to the conſequent of the ſecond croſſewayes: if 4 monethes giue 10 degrees, then 6 monethes ſhall giue 15 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Therefore ſeeing the proportion is moued croſſewayes: and thereby may be handled more conueniently, and may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conceiued by this meanes of the learner,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:11804:52"/> therefore in the ordering of the termes, we place them which be of like ſort croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in ſundrie places, not ioyntly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>And hereupon the queſtion being moued ſomewhat confuſedly, we muſt ſet that terme that hath the queſtion adioyned vnto it in the third place, and the terme of the ſame kinde, that is the terme which betokeneth the ſame thing, and is called by the ſame name in the firſt place: and the other in the middeſt: then muſt we followe the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode and direction of the rule, multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thirde by the ſecond, or contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the ſecond by the third, and diuiding the product by the firſt.</p>
               <p>The examples.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A traueller is to goe 180 miles, vvhereof he goeth 9 in two dayes, the queſtion is vvhen he ſhall end his iourney.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the queſtion beeing propounded ſomewhat confuſedly, you ſet in order the termes. And for ſo much as the queſtion is moued about the 180 miles, in what time they may be gone thorough, you ſhall ſet that number in the third place, the 9 miles being a terme of the ſame ſort, ſhall ſtande in the firſt place, the two dayes in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. Then multiply 2 by 180, and diuide the product 360 by 9, the quotient wil be 40,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:11804:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> the fourth number in proportion anſwering the queſtion. The example is thus:</p>
               <p>If 9 require 2 dayes, ergo 180, 40 daies. If a pole ſixe foote long ſtanding vpright vppon the ground caſteth a ſhadowe tenne foote long, I demaund how high that Tower is, vvhich at the ſame time caſteth a ſhadowe 125 foote long.</p>
               <p>Here I ſee that the numbers giuen are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionall. For as the height of the pole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowen is vnto the ſhadowe, ſo is the hight of the tower vnknowen vnto his ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. The termes therefore being ſet duely in order, and handled according vnto the rule, the example ſhall be thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If 10 giue 6: ergo 125 ſhall giue</hi> 75.</p>
               <p>After the ſame manner in this rule may the parts be ordered and handled, as may be perceiued by the examples following:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the ſixt part of the Moone encreaſeth vvhen ſhe is diſtant from the Sunne the twelfth part of a circle: how bigge ſhall ſhe be when ſhe is diſtant from him halfe a circle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the firſt terme ſhall be 1/12 of a circle, the ſecond 1/6 of the Moone, which in that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is lightened with the light of the Sun: the third 1/2, the worke being wrought there ariſeth 1, which ſignifieth that the Moone is at the full when ſhe is halfe a circle off from the ſunne. The termes are thus:</p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:11804:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>1/12 1/6 ergo 1/2 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſpend in the fourth part of a moneth 5/6 of a crowne, vvhat doe I ſpend in 7/10 of a moneth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the termes are giuen in order, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I multiply the third by the ſecond, the facit will be 7/12, which being diuided by 1/4 af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of parts or fractions, the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient will be 2 1/3, ſo that the example ſhall be thus:</p>
               <p>1/4 5/6: ergo 7/10 2 1/3.</p>
               <p>But here if you deſire to knowe the value of 1/3 of a crowne or of any other fraction what ſo euer, you ſhall ſearch it out in like manner by the rule. For that they teach com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, that the number made by multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the numerator, and the partes of the whole being knowen, muſt be diuided by the denominator, whereuppon proceedeth the value of the parts giuen, it is nothing elſe but to practiſe the rule of proportion. For it is all one, as if you ſhould ſet the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the parts in the firſt place, the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator in the third, and the parts of the whole being knowen in the middlemoſt place, and ſo worke accordingly. As, put caſe three parts of a crowne be 45 pence, you ſhall find out the value of 1/3 part thus:</p>
               <p>If 3 be 45 pence: I ſhall be 15 pence.</p>
               <p>If one or more of the termes be mixt, you muſt vſe the ſame methode which before was
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:11804:53" rendition="simple:additions"/> vſed in whole and broken numbers: ſauing that both the whole and broken numbers muſt firſt be reduced into fractions. As the queſtion being moued, two yardes and 1/6 of cloth are bought for fiue crownes, what ſhall I pay for 5 3/4 of a yarde: you ſhall reduce ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt terme vnto 13/6, the ſecond vnto 5/13 the third vnto 23/4, whereof there amount 13 crownes &amp; 7/26, which is the number required.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Certaine abridgements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In whole numbers it ſhall not be amiſſe to haue regarde vnto the abridgement follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If of the proportionall numbers giuen, the firſt and ſecond, or the firſt and thirde be compound one to another, then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diuided by the greateſt common diuiſor: the proportion ſhall be more briefly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the prime numbers.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this abridgement is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the termes being chaunged after this manner, yet the proportion is not chaunged by the 15 prop of the fifth booke, where it is ſaide, that <hi>Like parts of multiplices, and alſo their multiplices compared together haue one and the ſame proportion.</hi> As in 12, 32, 15, becauſe 12 and 32 are compound one vnto the other, therfore they being diuided by 4, I take their quotients 3 and 8 in ſtead of the numbers gluen. Thus, if 3 giue 8, therefore 15 ſhall giue 40.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe ſeeing the firſt and the third that
<pb facs="tcp:11804:54"/> is to ſay 12 and 15 are alſo compound the on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> vnto the other: taking their quotient 4 and 5, being prime numbers found out by their greateſt common Diuiſor, for the numbers giuen, the proportion may be eaſily conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If 4 be 32: therefore 5 ſhall be</hi> 40.</p>
               <p>In the fractions it ſeemeth a briefe kind of working to diſpatch the matter by multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation onely: to wit, if you take the number made by multiplying of the denominator of the firſt terme, by the numerator of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond terme, and then by the numerator of the third terme, for the numerator of the fourth: and the <hi>facit</hi> of the numerator of the firſt terme, by the denominators of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and third for the denominator of the 4.</p>
               <p>The draught of them is thus:</p>
               <gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <p>As if 1/4 giue 2/3, what ſhall 5/6 giue? Multiply 4 by 2, there ariſeth 8, then by 5, the product is 40, which is the numerator of the number which we ſeeke for. Furthermore multiply 1 by 3, and then by 6, the <hi>facit</hi> will be 18, the denominator of the fourth terme. The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is thus:</p>
               <p>1/4 2/3 ergo 5/6 40/18, or 2 2/9.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But oftentimes it requireth ſome certaine kind of numeration to goe before it: the vvhich nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſerueth to the ordering of the termes of the principall proportion, according to the nature and lawes of the queſtion propounded, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the proportionall number, vvhich vve deſire to know, might be vvith more eaſily found out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this numeration is drawen out of both the partes of Arithmeticke: Sometime out of abſolute or ſimple Arithmeticke, and is either ſimple or mixt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great is the varietie of thoſe queſtions which may be reſolued by Geometricall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. Wherefore here wit is to be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that by the former conditions and nature of the queſtion offered, wee may be able to perceiue what is meete for the vnknitting and concluſion of the proportion, and howe alſo (as it were a certaine preparatiue to the future demonſtration) the termes of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion lying hid, are to be vnfolded, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſet downe, and to be applyed to the rule it ſelfe.</p>

                  <hi>A Polonian going vnto the Vniuerſitie of Baſill to ſtudie, deliuereth vnto a Marchant 126 golden Ducats (euery one being valued at 28 vrſati, to receiue againe of him for them at Baſill ſiluerlings (vvhich commonly are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Thaleri) being vvorth 18 vrſati. The queſtion is how many ſiluerlings he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here you ſhall reduce by multiplication 126 ducats vnto vrſati, accounting to euerie ducate 28, whereof the whole ſumme amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnto 3528 vrſati. Then looke what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion there is betweene 18 vrſati, and one ſiluerling, the ſame there is betweene the whole number of the vrſati, and betwene the ſiluerlings which we ſeeke for. Wherefore the termes ſhall be thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>18 Vrſati are vvorth 1 Thaler.: ergo</hi> 3528, 196</p>
               <p>This and ſuch like examples may be alſo reſolued by the rule of reciprocall proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as ſhall appeare hereafter.</p>
               <p>

               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:11804:56"/>
               <p>Here I ſee there is a queſtion of proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moued, but for ſo much as the firſt and third termes be of a diuerſe denomination, I reduce them by multiplication to one kind of denomination. And ſo generally the terms of diuerſe kindes are by a former multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be drawen to the leaſt denomination. Therefore I take for a yeare 365 dayes, and that the account might be the more exact, I diuide the 34 crownes into 510 vrſati (recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning 15 vrſati to a crowne) or if it pleaſe you to bring them into a ſmaller coyne, you may reſolue them into pence, and then the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall be thus:</p>
               <p>365 510: <hi>ergo</hi> 8 11 13/73</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sometimes Multiplication goeth before with Addition or Subduction.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>For ſo much as the money here ſet downe is of a diuerſe denomination: firſt of all I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the 6 crownes by multiplication vnto vrſati: valuing euery crowne at 15 vrſati, the <hi>facit</hi> is 90. Whereunto if I adde the gaine, the whole ſumme of the vrſati, to wit, 100 ſhall be the middle terme of the proportion after this manner:</p>
               <p>If of 90 there ariſe 100: then of 20 22 2/9 In the leaſt termes thus: 9 10: <hi>ergo</hi> 20 22 2/9</p>

                  <hi>A Butcher deliuering vnto his ſeruant 216 crownes, ſent him to market vvilling him to buy as many Oxen, Calues, Weathers, and Hogges of euery one an euen number, as that money vvould afford him to buy: I demaund how many beaſts he bought.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt let vs appoint the prices: an Oxe at 11 crownes, a Calfe at two, a Weather at one crowne and 5 vrſati, an Hogge at 3 crownes and tenne vrſati. Here then is there a double multiplication with addition required, to the ordering out of the principall proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For here you muſt reſolue the 216 crownes by 15 (for at ſo many vrſati doe Germaines commonly value their crownes) into 3240 vrſari: and likewiſe reduce the ſeuerall prices of euerie beaſt vnto one denomination: to wit, the prices of the Oxen vnto 165, of the Calues vnto 30, of the Weathers vnto 20, of the Hogges vuto 55 vrſati, and then adde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the prices of the ſame denomination, the totall 270 ſhall be the firſt terme of the proportion. For as this number is to one of each kind of beaſts, ſo the whole ſummo of money is vnto the number of the beaſtes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen. The example is thus:</p>
               <p>270 <hi>giue 1: ergo</hi> 3240, 12</p>

               </p>
               <p>For the reſoluing of this queſtion, two termes of the principall proportion muſt be ſet downe, the one by multiplication, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſubduction. For firſt we muſt ſee how farre the theefe was gone before the owner eſpying the matter entred his iorney. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I multiply 128 furlongs by 4 dayes, the <hi>facit</hi> is 512 furlongs. Secondly, I conſider how much the latter outgoeth the former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day. Subducting therefore 128 from 174 the remainder is 46. Then looke what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the dayly exceſſe hath vnto a day, the ſame proportion ſhall there be betweene the former flight and all thoſe dayes wherein the latter ouertaketh the former.

               <p>
                  <hi>A certaine man ſelling his houſe for 75 crownes, findeth he hath gotten the fourth part of the money vvhich he paide for him, I demaunde vvhat he paide for him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here adde vnto the money which he gaue (which is ſuppoſed to be 4/4) the games, to wit 1/4, the totall will be 5/4: for he that of his ſtocke laide out raiſeth 1/4, he by 4 gaineth 5. Wherefore the principall proportion ſhal be thus: 5 75: <hi>ergo</hi> 4, 60</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Farmer hauing gotten by one yeares harueſt certaine ſackes of corne, payeth to his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords for his yeares rent, to one 2/5, to another 1/4, and hath remaining 35 ſackes: I demaund how many he had at the firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this and ſuch like examples of broken numbers hauing diuers denominations, out of the leaſt number which may commonly be diuided by the denominators of the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions giuen, muſt be drawen whole nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers being vnto the number diuided as the parts aſſigned do require. As here the leaſt number which may be diuided by the denominators ſet downe which are 5 &amp; 4, is 20: wherof 2/5 are 8, &amp; 1/4 is 5, which being added together, &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon denominator ſet vnderneath do make 13/20. The farmer then of his whole heap of corn which is ſuppoſed to be 20, paid 13, wherefore 13/20 being ſubducted out of 20/20, there remaine 7/20: wherupon the denominators being omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the termes ſhall thus be ſet together:</p>

                  <hi>A certaine man ſelling his horſe loſt the ſixth part and 2/15 of the money which he paid for it. and had remaining 243 crownes: the queſtion is vvhat the houſe coſt him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This example is like to the former. for you muſt take the leaſt number which may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly be diuided by the denominators of the parts giuen, 6 and 15, to wit, 30: whoſe parts being of the ſame denomination, to wit, 1/6 is 5, and 2/15 are 4. The partes added make 9/30, which being ſubducted from 20/30 leaue 21/30 where vpon the proportionall numbers according to the rule ſhall be:</p>

For the waight of all the pots being added to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, you ſhal haue halfe ounces 52 1/3: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the proportion ſhall be thus framed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If 1 coſt 11 1/2, therefore</hi> 52 1/3 601 5/6</p>

               </p>
               <p>Here ſubduction of mixt numbers muſt go before. For the price of the thing ſold for leſſe then it coſt being ſubducted out of the price which it was bought for, will bring out the ſecond terme of the proportion, ſo that you may eaſily anſwere the queſtion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 19 5/7 being ſubducted from 27 3/4 there remaines 7 11/12, the loſſe in 16 hogſheads of wine. Wherefore the termes of proportion ſhall thus be ſet downe:</p>

Now the enemie knowing of their comming, made toward them, ſo that at nine dayes end they met together. I demaund how farre the Captaine vvent before he met vvith the enemie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here firſt and formoſt we muſt gather the ſum of the proportion Arithmeticall (which commonly we call progreſſion) whoſe termes are 15, and the extremes 30, and 2: the whole ſumme, then is 240 furlongs, which is the ſecond terme ſeruing to conclude the Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall proportion on this manner.</p>
               <p>15 240: <hi>ergo</hi> 9 144</p>
               <p>So farre therefore they trauelled, the reſt, to wit, 96 furlongs the enemies went.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A labourer vvas hyred for this vvages, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the firſt day a pennie, the ſecond three, the third fiue, and after the ſame order his wages ſhould be continued for the dayes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: at length being diſmiſſed, he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

               </p>
               <p>Here if you gather together all the termes of the Arithmeticall progreſſion into one ſumme, you ſhall make a way to the Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall progreſſion. As for example, if you adde together his wages for 30 dayes, the firſt terme of the progreſſion being an vnitie, and the difference 2, the whole ſumme ſhall be 900 pence: whereupon I may conclude:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If 900 require 30: ergo</hi> 1500, 50.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the examples following, Geometricall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion muſt goe before to informe the principall proportion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When a vveb of cloth contayning 40 yardes is bought for 50 crownes, for how much ſhall he ſell the yard, that in an hundred crownes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to gaine</hi> 12?</p>
               <p>Before you can conclude the queſtion by Geometricall proportion, being as it were the decider of the whole controuerſie, you muſt ſeeke out the price of one yarde. If 40 yardes are bought for 50 crownes: then one yarde doth coſt 11 1/4 of a crowne. This ſhall be the third terme of the principall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in this manner. If of an</p>
               <p>100 crownes there ariſe 112: then of 1 1/4 there ariſe 1 2/5</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Marchant buying at Venice an hundred yardes of ſilke for a crowne a yearde, ſpent</hi>

                  <hi>in his iourney and for the carriage of them 30 crownes. At Lipſia vvhere the yarde is more by a quarter then the yarde of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, he ſolde euery yard for 3 crownes. The queſtion is vvhat he gayned?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this example addition of whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, together with proportion goeth before. For his ſtocke laide out, and his charges being added, the whole is 130. Beſides, to know how many yardes of Lipſia aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere the Venice meaſure, you ſhall worke by proportion on this manner. If 5/4 of Lipſia meaſure, make a yarde of Venice, then 80 yardes of Lipſia ſhall make an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Venice yardes. So that you may readily inferre the principall proportion thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If 1 is ſolde for 3: ergo</hi> 80 240</p>
               <p>Whereupon 130 crownes being the ſtocke and charges ſubducted out of 240, I ſee he gayned 110.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another marchant bought three hogsheads of honie.

               </p>
               <p>For ſo much as the price of one pound of honie is ſet downe, therefore by proportion
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:11804:61"/> ſeeke out the price of an hundred, 1 pound is ſolde for fiue pence: ergo 100, for 500 pence, then adde the waight of the veſſels, the whole is 110, adde alſo the waight of the three hogſheds, the totall is 935: whereupon you ſhall conclude:</p>
               <p>110 are ſold at 500 pence, ergo 935 at 4250, that is, 170 florentines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another buying two yardes of cloth at three crownes, ſolde ſixe yardes afterwardes for 11 crownes. Hauing got by this meanes 46 crownes, there ariſeth a queſtion howe many yardes he bought, and how many he ſold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before you can come vnto the principall proportion, you muſt order the termes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by a former proportion, and by ſubducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Firſt therefore you muſt conſider howe much the ſixe yardes of cloth which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes were ſolde at an higher price coſt at the firſt, the which may eaſily be inferred by that which is preſuppoſed in the queſtion: for if two yardes coſt three crownes, then ſix yardes coſt three crownes, then ſix yardes were ſold at nine crownes. This price I ſubduct from 11, and I ſee that ſixe yardes were ſold for two crownes more then they coſt. So that it is eaſie to reſolue the doubt thus:</p>

                  <hi>A <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>intener bought 1. 24 hogſheds of vvine on this condition, that ſubducting out of euerie two hogſheds becauſe of the leeſe fiue gallons, he ſhould pay for euery hogſhed 26 crovvines:
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:11804:61"/> Tell me vvhat he is to pay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Proportion going before with multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſubduction, will ſet in order the principall proportion. Firſt I ſeeke howe much is ſubducted out of al the hogſheds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the dragges. Out of two hogsheds are drawen 5 gallons, ergo out of 120 hogges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heds are drawen 310. Then I reduce all the foreſaid hogſheds vnto gallons, multiplying them by 32, for ſo many gallons doth euerie hogſhed hold, the <hi>facit</hi> is 3968. Out of theſe I ſubduct according to couenant 310 mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: the remainder is 3658 gallons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the proportion ſhall be thus:</p>
               <p>32 <hi>giue 26: ergo</hi> 3658 2972 1/8</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of two Carpenters, the one alone vvould frame an houſe in 30 daies, the other in 40. Now taking another vnto them, they finiſhed the vvorke in 15 dayes. In what time then would the third man haue made it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here muſt you vſe proportion with addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſubduction of fractions. The firſt would haue done the worke in 30 dayes, ergo in 15 daies he finiſhed 15/30 or 1/2 of the worke, the ſecond would haue wrought it in 40 daies ergo in 15 dayes he wrought 15/40 or 3/8. The partes added together are 7/8 of the worke: which being ſubducted out of 8/8, that is, out of the whole worke, there remaineth 1/8, the third mans worke. In ſo much that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion may thus be concluded:</p>
               <p>1/8 is framed in 15: ergo 1/1 120</p>

               </p>
               <p>To vnknit this knot you ſhall vſe propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with ſubduction of mixt numbers. Firſt I ſeeke what he paide for an hundred pound. If 14 pound be bought for 6 crownes, then 100 pound giue 42 6/7. Moreouer for ſo much as an hundred pound were ſolde for 47 crownes, therefore 42 6/7 being ſubducted out of 47, the remainder is 4 1/7 the gaine of an hundred: whereupon I ſay, If 4 1/7 come of 100, then 80 of 1931 1/29.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>HItherto of ſimple direct proportion: now muſt we come to Reciprocall proportion. Reciprocall proportion is that vvherein the termes being ſet downe croſſewaies, as the third is vnto the ſecond, ſo reciprocally the firſt is to the fourth.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:11804:62"/>
               <p>A mong the vulgar people we call Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procation the going backewarde the ſame way we begunne: which is euidently ſeene in reciprocall proportion being compared with direct proportion.</p>
               <p>For that way that direct proportion go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on forwarde, the ſame way reciprocall proportion returneth backwarde. For in direct proportion the termes are proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, not onely as they ſtand in order, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo croſſewayes: that is to ſay, as the firſt is to the ſecond, ſo the third is to the fourth, and alſo as the firſt is to the third, ſo the ſeconde is to the fourth. But in reciprocall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the termes being taken firſt order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are altogether without proportion, and croſſewayes they differ in all reſpects in that one is of greater inequalitie, the other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes of leſſe: yea rather as the third is to the ſecond, ſo backwardes, the firſt is to the fourth, in ſo much that that which in direct proportion was the firſt terme, is the thirde in reciprocall proportion: and againe that which is the third in direct proportion, is the firſt in reciprocall proportion.</p>
               <p>For example ſake, if twelue hyred ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes doe their worke in 8 dayes, then 24 ſhall doe it in foure dayes. Here are ſet downe foure termes of reciprocall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, which being placed directly ſhall ſtande thus:

                  </gap> ſtion I muſt vſe the rule of reciprocall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion on this manner:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If 40 require 7: then 70 how many?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Multiply 40 by 7, the <hi>facit</hi> ſhall be 280, which being diuided by 70, giueth 4 or two ounces, which is the waight of the loafe. <hi>Three milles in two dayes grinde 20 buſhels of corne, in what time then ſhall fiue milles grind ſo many buſhels?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here againe by how many more milles there be, in ſo much leſſe time they ſhal grind the corne. Wherefore the proportion ſhall be concluded reciprocally in this manner.</p>
               <p>3 <hi>grinde 2: ergo</hi> 5 1 1/5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A certaine man borrowing 66 crownes of his friend, and repaying them at ſeuen monethes end, promiſeth to pleaſure his credit or in as great a matter. Whereupon the creditor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward deſired to borrow of him 112 crowns, but they doubt how long time he ſhould keepe the money, that the lending of his money might be correſpondent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For ſo much as the latter man deſired to borrow the greater ſumme, therefore he is bound to reſtore it ſooner then the firſt ſhold, whoſe ſumme was leſſe: whereupon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocation ſhall be concluded thus:</p>
               <p>66 <hi>giue 7: ergo</hi> 112 4 1/8.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe the former example of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing 126 Hungarie ducats (each of them
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:11804:64"/> being valued at 28 vrſati) vnto Thaleri be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worth 18 vrſati, may be handled and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued after this faſhion.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manifold proportion is that vvhich conſiſteth of more thenfoure termes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Simple proportion diſiunct, conſiſteth of foure termes, but manifold proportion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of more, as when in one and the ſame proportion there be manie conſequents to one antecedent, or contrariwiſe, or elſe when there be two rowes of nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers proportionall in two numbers, or ſome ſuch like manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manifolde proportion is double: for either it is compounded in the termes, or els continued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt ioyneth together the termes giuen, either by one onely kinde of numeration, to vvit, either by addition or multiplication, or elſe by more, as by addition and multiplication together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Compound proportionalitie or propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſaid to be that wherein the termes are vnited together. But the things ſo vnited and ioyned together, are of many brought into one, and heaped together two maner of waies, either by addition or multiplication alone, or elſe both waies together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By Addition, as when many as well antecedents as conſequents are taken and compared, as one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to one conſequent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although proportions may be compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many wayes by Addition, yet of them all this is the moſt vſuall: wherefore this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:11804:65"/> definition ſeruing moſt for this purpoſe is taken in ſtead of that which is more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. For example ſake, if 3 vnto 2, be as 9 vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 6, then by addition 3 and 9 that is 12, ſhall be in like manner vnto 2 and 6, that is 8, ſo that the termes of the proportion may ſtand as you ſee,</p>
               <p>12 vnto 8: are as 3 to 2 and 9 to 6</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In this kind of manifold proportion, the rule following is to be vſed,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If in the termes of manifold proportion the conſequent of the one proportionality be giuen added together, and the antecedents ſeuerally by themſelues, then as the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents knit together by addition, are vnto the conſequents added, ſo ſhall the ſeuerall ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents be vnto their ſeuerall conſequents, and ſo contrariwiſe.</p>
               <p>This is the 12 p. 7, ſauing that it is reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and applyed ſome what more fitly to this purpoſe. For the words of the propoſition be theſe: <hi>If there be a multitude of numbers, how many ſo euer proportionall, as one of the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents is to one of the conſequents, ſo are all the antecedents vnto all the conſequents.</hi> And the ſame backeward is true alſo. By which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion it appeareth how the examples which commonly are referred vnto the rule of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhippe, hauing many proportions cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled by addition, are to be handled and to be
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:11804:66"/> reſolued by the rule of proportion, in which examples the antecedents of the one propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are ſet downe ſeuerally, to wit, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions of the partners, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents are added together, to wit, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gaine or loſſe. So that the contributions and common ſtocke of the partners, or elſe generally all thoſe numbers into which the other is to bee diſtributed proportionally muſt be added together, and the totall muſt be ſet in the firſt place in ſtead of the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of the firſt proportion, whoſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent muſt be the foreſaide number which is taken to be diſtributed proportionally. In the third place the termes compounded by addition muſt be placed ſeuerally, &amp; the rule muſt be repeated as often as there be ſeuerall numbers, whereupon I may conclude the proportion. As in the examples following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Three men being partners laide their money to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the firſt 60, the ſecond 100, the third 135 crownes. Nowe they gayned after a vvhile 45 crownes. The queſtion is howe much of the gaines each of them by duetie ought to haue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this and ſuch like examples equitie and reaſon requireth, that that which is gotten by the common ſtocke ſhould alſo be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and ſhould be ſo diſtributed, that euery mans portion ſhould haue the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the whole gaine, that the mony which

               <p>Here that which the firſt man laide down being couertly expreſſed, muſt be gathered out of the couenant. For in that he was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue twice ſo much as the ſecond, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that that which he laide out was twice as much as that whereof the ſecond was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributary, whether it were money, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were his labour, or whether it were valued in both. Wherefore if for the firſt you take 48 crownes the double of 24, then they being added together, the whole doubt ſhall be remooued by the rule on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XX. Of multiplied proportion compound by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, vvhich commonly is called the double Rule.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>THe former examples appertained vnto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion compound by addition: now follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that vvhich is compound by multiplicacion, vvhich in ſtead of two termes of the proportion, vſeth the</hi> facit <hi>made of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the right compounding of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, which gathereth them together by multiplication as was ſaid before, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the fift definition of the ſixth booke of Euclide, becauſe it doth not only ioyne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the termes themſelues, but alſo maketh the proportion of the compound termes to comprehend the proportion of the ſimple. Wherefore hitherto are to be referred, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:11804:69"/> by this rule of proportion are to be handled theſe examples, wherein two termes by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication muſt be reduced vnto one: for there proportion as appeareth by the fifth prop. of the eighth booke of Euclide, is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered of the proportion of the termes mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied one by the other. Of this ſort are all thoſe examples which commonly are refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the double rule, wherein two termes are ſet in the ſame places, that is, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall proportion hath a certaine circumſtance adioyned vnto it, in ſo much that here the proportion ſhould be twice concluded, were it not that for thoſe two termes the products made of them are taken as one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The termes propounded by multiplication, are either of the ſame place, as in direct proportion, or of diuerſe places, as in reciprocall proportion.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Here betwene the expences of foure ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in three monethes, there is obſerued the ſame proportion which is betweene the expences of 8 ſtudents in 9 moneths, to wit, the proportion compound of the two, to wit, of 4 vnto 8, and 3 vnto 9, or to ſpeake more plainely, the expences are one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as thrice foure vnto nine times eight. The which may eaſily be proued, if you put in the meane proportionall number to whom the termes of the antecedents and conſequents may belong. So that if you ſhould ſet it downe that foure ſtudent in 9 monethes ſhould make their expence, the example will be thus:</p>

               <p>Here then if foure ſtudents in three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes diſpende euery one but one, then ſo many ſtudents in nine monethes ſhall ſpende thrice as much. Wherefore the proportion
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:11804:70"/> of the expences of A vnto B, ſhall be the ſame that is betwene three and nine. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if foure ſtudents in nine moneths ſpend euerie one but one, then 8 ſtudents in as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie monethes will ſpende twiſe as much. Whereupon there will be the ſame reaſon betweene B and C, as is betweene 4 and 8.</p>
               <p>Furthermore if you multiply 3 and 9, the termes of the firſt reaſon by one and the ſame number, namely by 4, the productes, namely 12 and 36, ſhall keepe the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by the 17 propoſition of the 7 of Euclide: ſo ſhall 36 and 72 being made of 4 and 8 multiplyed by 9. Whereby it is gathered that as the charges of A is vnto B, ſo is 12 vnto 36. And in like manner as B is vnto C, ſo is 36 vnto 72. To conclude, ſeeing there are here three proportionall numbers, A, B, C, and as many more in number an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable vnto them 12, 36, 72, therefore by the 14 of the 7 (taking the extremes the meane proportionals being withdrawen) the charges of A ſhall be all one to the charges of C, as 12 is vnto 72, whereby the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the working doth appeare.</p>

Therefore the firſt mans 22 crownes being multiplied by his 5 moneths, the <hi>facit</hi> is 550. Whereupon I conclude, if his money, that loſt 22 crownes, multiplied by the time doth make 550, what ſhall the loſſe of 18 crownes? and what ſhall the loſſe of 12 crownes make?

               <p>The fourth numbers inferred by the rule of three are compounded of ech mans ſtocke multiplyed by the time for which it was laid out. Therefore ech of them ſeuerally diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his owne ſtocke, the time is ſeuerally inferred, ſo that the ſecond mans money was out of his handes fiue monethes and 5/14, the third mans money was out foure and 8/13 of a moneth.</p>

               <p>Here therefore I multiply 9 by 18 and make 162 the firſt terme, likewiſe I multiply 8 by 24 and make 192 the third terme, whereby the lawfull induction of the proportion is thus diſpatched:</p>
               <p>162 12: therefore 192 14 2/9</p>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:11804:73"/> In this queſtion for ſo much as a greater intereſt is ſought for by a leſſer ſtocke of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, the reciprocation is manifeſt, the which intereſt craueth ſo much the more time by how much the more the ſtocke is leſſer.

               <head>CHAP. XXI. Of manifold proportion compounded by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication and addition.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>THus much concerning the examples of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion compounded by addition or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication onely: now muſt vve proceede to that proportion vvhich ioyneth both kindes of nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore proportion compounded by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and addition, is that vvhich firſt of all multiplieth the manifold termes giuen one with another, and then addeth their productes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This kinde of proportion by a two folde, yea ſometimes by a fourefolde compoſition, bringeth many termes into one. Vnto this
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:11804:73"/> appertaine the examples of the Rule of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond fellowſhip, as they commonly cal them, wherein the time is annexed to the ſtocke, or ſome other circumſtance to the principall terme. The Theoreme following ſerueth for the working of thoſe examples.</p>
               <p>If among the termes of the manifold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, the conſequents of one reaſon be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen added together, but ſome antecedents be giuen ſeuerally and double: then as the antecedents compounded by multiplication and addition are vnto the conſequents added together, ſo ſhall the ſeuerall antecedents compounded by multiplication be vnto the ſeuerall conſequents.</p>
               <p>As thus for example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Two men in common trafficke got 60 crownes, the firſt brought 50 crownes for two yeare, the ſecond 15 for fiue yeare: vvhat ſhall be ech man his ſhare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this queſtion containing a partnerſhip of equall contributions in regard of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe times, I ſee the diuiſion of the gaine muſt be made according to the proportion of the time. That this diuiſion may be made the conſequents of the latter reaſon are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen added together, namely 60, but the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents are giuen not only ſeuerally, but alſo double, as you ſee here.</p>

               <p>Therefore firſt of all I compound the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble termes by multiplication, ſo that after a ſort I reduce the vnequall times to an equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the products are 100 and 75, which are all one as if you ſhould ſay, that the firſt man ſhould haue as much gaine by 100 crownes in one yeare, as he ſhould haue for 50 crownes in 2 yeare. In like manner the ſecond man ſhould get by 75 crownes in one yeare, as much as he ſhould get by 15 crownes in fiue yeare. Moreouer theſe two products 100 and 75 ſet downe ſeuerally, ſhall poſſeſſe the third place of the proportion: but added together they ſhall ſtand in the firſt place: nowe the rule of three twice repeated, ſhall deliuer the numbers ſought for in this manner:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>175 60: therefore 100 34 2/7</item>
                  <item>175 60: therefore 75 25 5/7</item>
               </list>
               <p>I doe of ſet purpoſe omit the demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this compoſition of the termes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not much vnlike the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A hundred and ſixtie footmen and fortie horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men got a bootie of 138 crownes to be diuided betweene them ſo, that as often as the footmen receiued one, the horſemen ſhoulde receiue
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:11804:74"/> three. How much were the footemen, howe much vvere the horſemen to haue?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here likewiſe I place the conſequents of the ſecond reaſon added together in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, namely, 138: in the thirde place I ſet the products made by multiplying the numbers ſignifying how often ech one ſhold take his ſhare by the number of the ſouldiers: namely, 160 and 120, theſe added together and making 280, ſhall haue the firſt place. The example is thus:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>280 138: therefore 160 78 6/7</item>
                  <item>280 138: therefore 120 59 1/7</item>

               <p>
                  <hi>Three Butchers hyred a meddow together, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to pay yearely rent for it 30 crownes, the firſt fedde in it 20 Oxen 70 daies, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond fedde 46 Oxen 56 dayes, the third fedde 32 Oxen 60 dayes: How much of the rent ſhall each partner pay?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe therefore I multiply each mans heard by the ſeueral times, the products 1400, 2576, 1920, ſhall poſſeſſe the third place: and being added together, they ſhall haue the firſt place, the yearely rent ſhall be in the middeſt thus:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>5896 30: therefore 1400 7 91/737</item>
                  <item>5896 30: therefore 2576 13 79/737</item>
                  <item>5896 30: therefore 1920 9 567/737</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Three marchants were partners for a yeare. The firſt in the beginning brought 250 crownes, but after 3 moneths he withdrew 100. The
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:11804:75"/> ſecond after 2 moneths brought 180 crownes, but after 6 moneths of their partnerſhip were expired, he tooke away 50. The third after three moneths brought in 235 crownes, and after fiue moneths added 45 crownes. Now hauing gotten 68 crownes, what is each mans ſhare?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe kind of examples being in outward ſhew moſt intricate, require a litle more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, otherwiſe they are to be handled by the ſame art. They wil ſoone be diſpatched, if you indeuor but to ſeuer euerie mans time accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as he changed his ſtocke, and make as many multiplications as there were changes. As in this preſent example: Becauſe the firſt man left in the partnerſhip 250 crownes for three moneths, let them be multiplied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the product will be 750. Then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing 100 crownes, he left but 150 for the nine moneths remaining. Wherfore theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againe multiplied by their time, make 1350. Which numbers being added, the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſumme for the firſt partner is 2100.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the ſecond man his 180 crownes being multiplied by the 4 moneths wherein he left them in the common trafficke, doe make 720. Moreouer 50 crownes being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted from 180 (for ſo manie he fetcht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the principall after the ſixth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of their partner ſhip) there remaine 130 crownes, which if you multiply by the ſixe moneths remaining, the product will be 780,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:11804:75"/> which added to the former, maketh 1500.</p>
               <p>So alſo multiplie the third man his 235 crownes by 9, they make 2115. Item 45 by 7, they make 315, which added to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, make 2430. Theſe termes being thus compounded, if you proceed as you did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the proportion will be inferred, which here you ſee ſet downe, with ordering of the whole example.</p>

                  <hi>HItherto we haue ſpoken of the firſt kinde of compound proportion: the ſecond followeth, and is called Alligation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alligation is an art, vvhich (by the meanes of certaine things giuen) maketh equall the totall made of the prices of the meaſures mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vnto the totall made of prices of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures taken ſeuerally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is 100 pound waight of ſiluer worth 17 pound to be mingled with other ſiluer worth 24 pound, ſo that the totall made of the prices of the waightes mingled together may be equall to the totall made of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the waights taken ſeuerally. Here all the prices are giuen, the art therefore which by the meanes of theſe prices giuen maketh equall the totall numbers is Alligation.</p>
               <p>Item, Of two kinds of corne mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſuppoſe there were 10 buſhels worth 16 ſhillings, and 18 buſhels worth 12 ſhillings: foure buſhels of this mingled corne are to be ſold, ſo that the totall ſumme made of the prices of the 28 buſhels mingled together be equall to the totall made of the prices of the 10 and 18 buſhels ſeuerally taken. Here both the number and the price of the ſimple meaſures are giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but there is but only a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain part giuen of the number of the meaſures mingled together. The art therefore which by the meanes of the thinges giuen maketh
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:11804:77"/> equall the totals propounded in the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is called Alligation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The propertie of Alligation is this, that the meaſures in it be alike: but the price of the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled meaſure muſt be in quantitie meane between the prices of the meaſures ſeuerally giuen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A buſhell of corne worth 16 ſhillings is ſuppoſed to bee mingled with a buſhell of corne worth 18 ſhillings. Here by this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty firſt of all the buſhels are like meaſures. Then the price of a mingled buſhell muſt be in a quantitie meane betweene 16 and 18. that is to ſay, it muſt be greater then 16, and leſſe then 18. So that the price of a ſimple meaſure is called the Extreme, but the price of a mingled meaſure is the Meane.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIII. Of Prime Alligation, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie thereof.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>ALLigation is two fold. Prime, which doeth counterchange the differences of the termes from the meane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the definition of Alligation generally taken it appeareth, that in all alligation there are certaine things giuen. Therfore in Prime alligation generally let all prices be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be giuen. Moreouer to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terchange the differences of the extremes, is nothing elſe but to attribute the difference of the leſſer extreme to the greater extreme, and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:11804:77"/> to attribute the difference of the greater extreame to the leſſer extreame. Nowe this counterchaunge is therfore vſed, that we may thereby make equall the totall made of the prices of the meaſures ſeuerally taken vnto the totall of the prices of the meaſures min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled together. That this may be the better demonſtrated, we muſt firſt of all ſet downe two premiſſes. The firſt is this:</p>
               <p>If one and the ſame number doe multiply certaine numbers ſeuerally, and the totall made of them being added together, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct made of the totall ſhall be equall to the totall made of the products of the parts.</p>
               <p>As here: let 10 be the totall number made of 4 and 6, let the number multiplying them all, be 2, the products made of 4 and 6, are 8 and 12, and the totall made of them is 20. Therefore the product made of 10 by 2 ſhall be 20.</p>
               <p>The ſecond premiſſe is this:</p>
               <p>If three vnequall numbers being giuen, you multiply any one of them by the other two remayning, and augment the ſelfe ſame number by one of them which remaine, and diminiſh it by the other: and then multiply the number augmented by that which was taken away, and the number diminiſhed by that which was added to: the totall number made of the latter products ſhall be equall to the totall made of the former products.</p>
               <p>As here: Let there be three vnequall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:11804:78"/> 4, 7, 9, multiply 9 by 4 and 7, and let the products be 36 and 63, then augment and diminiſh the ſelfe ſame number 9 as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, adde therefore 7 vnto it, and let the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall be 16, alſo from 9 take 4, and let the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder be 5, then multiply 16 by 4, and 5 by 7, and let the products be 64 and 35: here the totall made of 64 and 35, ſhall be equall to the totall made of 36 and 63.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being thus ſet downe: nowe of two kindes of wine, let one be worth 14 pence, another worth 11 pence, let the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be 2 and 1 from the meane, which is 12 pence. The totall made of the differences is 3. The meane price is 12, the extreames are 14 and 11. Therefore multiply the meane which is 12, by the totall made of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, namely by 3, the product is 36, that is to ſay, three pottles worth 12 pence a peece ſhall be worth 36 pence, I ſay therefore that one pottle worth 14 pence, and two pottles worth 11 pence a peece ſhall be worth 36 pence. That is: I ſay that the totall made of 1 and 2, by 14 and 11, is 36. For here 3 is the totall made of 1 and 2 as was aforeſaid. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the firſt premiſſe if you multiply 12 by 2 and 1, the totall made of the productes 24 and 12 ſhall be equall to the product made of 12 and 3. But 12 multiplied by 3 maketh 36, therefore the totall of the products made of 12 multiplyed by 2 and 1 ſhall be 36.</p>
               <p>Againe theſe three numbers 11, 12, and 14
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:11804:78"/> are vnequall, the differences of the extremes 14 and 11 from 12, which is the meane, are 2 and 1. The greater extreame 14 is 12 more by 2, the leſſer extreme 11 is 12 leſſe by 1. Therefore by the ſecond premiſſe if you mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply 12, augmented by 1, which was taken from it, and 12 diminiſhed by 2, which was added to it: that is to ſay, if you multiply 14 by 1, and 11 by 2, the totall made of their products ſhall be equall to the totall made of the products of 12 multiplyed by 1 &amp; 2. But the total of the products made of 12 by 1 and 2 is 36, as it appeared before: therefore the totall of the products made of 1 and 2 by 14 and 11, ſhall be alſo 36, which was the thing to be demonſtrated. Therfore the reaſon why with vſe this counterchaunging is as you ſee.</p>
               <p>Here this alſo is to be noted:</p>
               <p>If ech number of the extreames be a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of multitude, the differences may be counterchaunged diuerſely: and therefore then in one and the ſame example a diuerſe alligation may be made.</p>
               <p>But all Alligation maketh equall the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall made of the prices of the mixt meaſures to the totall made of the meaſures ſeuerally taken, as appeareth by the definition of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall alligation: wherefore in the alligation intended when each number of the extremes is a number of multitude, the counterchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the differences is at our owne choiſe.</p>
               <p>Hereafter followe two proprieties, and as
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:11804:79"/> many kindes of prime alligation. The firſt proprietie is thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the extremes be equall in number, each of them is compared with the meane but once onely.</hi>

               <p>In this example the greater number of the extremes is 2, and therefore the extreme of the leſſer number is twiſe compared with the meane. Where alſo you ſhall note that the totall made of the manifold differences attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted

               <p>Wherefore with 12 buſhels at 14 pence the buſhell were mingled 156 buſhels at 9 pence the buſhell, and 12 buſhell of each of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kindes.</p>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:11804:81"/> are to be mingled together, ſo that a pound of the mingled ſiluer be worth 15 pound. Nowe there were taken 33 pound of the ſiluer worth 16 pound, the queſtion is how many pound of each other kind is to be taken?</hi>

               <p>For the firſt terme of the proportion, I take the difference added to the extreme whoſe meaſures are by number giuen, namely one pound worth 16 pound, but for the third I take the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the meaſures giuen, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 33 pound at 16 pound the pound. Then I conclude the queſtion propounded by three ſimple proportions, the firſt proportion is thus:</p>
               <p>1 pound worth 16 pound, requireth one pound worth 14 pound: therefore 33 pound worth 16 pound the pound, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire 33 pound worth 14 pound the pound.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is thus:</p>
               <p>1 pound worth 16 pound, requireth three pound worth 20 pound the pound: therfore 33 pound worth 16 pound the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:11804:81"/> pound require 99 pound worth 20 pound the pound.</p>
               <p>The third is thus:</p>
               <p>1 pound worth 16 pound, requireth fiue pound worth 12 pound the pound: therfore 33 pound worth 16 pound the pound require 165 pound worth 12 pound the pound.</p>
               <p>Therefore if there were 33 pound taken of the ſiluer worth 16 pound the pound, there might be taken 33 pound of the ſiluer worth 14 pound the pound, and 99 pound of the ſiluer worth 20 pound the pound, and 165 pound worth 12 pound the pound, I ſay they may be taken, but it is not needefull they ſhould be taken. For ſeeing that here each number of the extremes is a number of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, therefore the alligation may be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde, according as I noted it before in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of prime alligation.</p>
               <p>The prices of the ſame kinds of ſiluer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept, if there had bene 6 pound taken of the ſiluer worth 16 pound the pound, and 8 pound of the ſiluer worth 12 pound the pound, that a pound of the mingled ſiluer might be worth 15 pound, you ſhall ſay thus:</p>
               <p>1 pound worth 16 pound requireth 5 pound worth 12 pound: therefore 6 pound worth 16 pound the pound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth 30 worth 12 pound the pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</p>
               <p>And therfore vnto thoſe 8 pound worth 12 pound the pound, there are to bee added

               <p>This compound proportion is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the rule of Fellowſhip. In it for the firſt terme of proportion we take the totall made of the differences added together: for the ſecond, we take the totall made of the number of the meaſures, and for the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the reaſons remaining, the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>channged differences of the extremes from the meane.</p>

               <p>For the firſt terme I take the totall made of the differences which is 6. For the ſecond terme I take 6, and for the antecedents of the reaſons remayning I take 2 and 4, and then I make a compounded proportion in this manner:</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Hiero King of Syracuſa voweth to the goddes for the proſperous ſucceſſe of his affaires a crowne of gold. Let vs ſuppoſe that Hiero for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this crowne gaue vnto a vvorkeman 500 pound of gold: and that the workeman made in deede a crowne of iuſt vvaight, but mingled ſome ſiluer in the crowne. The king demaundeth of Archimedes how much golde, how much ſiluer was in the mingled crowne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the reſoluing of this queſtion Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes tooke two lumpes of mettall of the ſame waight with the crown, but of the ſame
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:11804:83"/> kind with the gold and ſiluer which was in the crowne. I ſay they muſt be of the ſame kind. For let there be two lumps of ſiluer of equall waight one to an other, but of vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qall fineneſſe, the finer lumpe ſhall fill a leſſer place then the other which is not ſo fine. The ſame is to be ſaid of the lumpe of gold. So that here will be a moſt manifeſt error, if the mettals be they either golde or ſiluer, be not both of one kind. I ſay therefore that the lumpe both of golde and ſiluer was of the ſame kinde with the golde and ſiluer in the crowne.</p>
               <p>Now let there be 3 ſuch bodies choſen: let the one be a lumpe of gold, the other a lump of ſiluer, the third the crowne mingled of gold and ſiluer. And let them be hanged one after another ſeuerally in a veſſell full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and let the waight of the firſt be 968, of the ſecond 952, of the third 964. Then let the waights be taken for the value of the bodies themſelues: the value therefore of the lumpe of gold ſhall be 968, of the ſiluer 952, of the crowne 964. Now in the mingled crowne by ſuppoſition there are 500 pound waight: therefore here the totall example made of the numbers of the meaſures ſhall be 500, ſo that the differences being counterchaunged as you ſee:</p>

               <p>For the firſt terme I take the totall made of the differences, namely 16, for the ſecond I take the totall made of the numbers of the meaſures ſought for, namely 500, for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedents of the reaſons remaining. I take 12 and 4, and thereof frame a compound pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in this manner:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>16 500: therefore 4 125</item>
                  <item>16 500: therefore 12 375</item>
               </list>
               <p>Whereby it is inferred that there was in the mingled crowne 125 pound of ſiluer, and 375 of gold.</p>
               <p>Archimedes in Vitruuius is ſaide to haue found out the mixture of the golde, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his reaſon on the differences of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter running out of the veſſell. But that the art may ſtand ſure, I conſtrue his manner of reaſon thus: that is to ſay, that by the knowen differences of the water running out of the veſſell Archimedes attained vnto the other differences of the water vnknowen, and then at length anſwered the queſtion by prime al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of the ſecond kind. Otherwiſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an vnequall running out of the water, that is to ſay, when the gold was put in, ſay that there ranne out 20, when the ſiluer was put in 36, and when the crowne was put in 24. Theſe ſeuerall quantities of water run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out are to be taken for the values of the bodies as they were put in, according to the intent of him which gaineſayeth mine aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:11804:84"/> Therefore the value of a lumpe of gold of 500 pound, ſhall be leſſer then the value of a maſſe of ſiluer of the ſame waight, which is againſt reaſon. Therefore Archimedes by the knowen differences of the water running out, attained to the differences of the water remaining in this manner. Suppoſe that the veſſell into the which the crownes were put were 488 pintes. If therefore the water which ranne out when the lumpe of golde was put in were 20 pintes, the reſt was 468, the like we may iudge of the reſt.</p>

Then I multiply 10 by 16, and 18 by 12, and make 160 and 216, the totall of them is 376. The totall therefore of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſimple meaſures is 376 pence. But alligation maketh the totall of the prices of the mixt meaſures equall to the totall of the ſimple meaſures as appeareth by the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. Therefore theſe 28 mingled bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhels ſhall be worth 376. Therfore I conclude the queſtion thus:</p>
               <p>28 mingled buſhels are worth 376. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one buſhell of mingled corne is worth 13 3/7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P. Ramus</hi> the moſt famous Philoſopher of our time, calleth this alligation, alligation of the meane ſought for: and defineth it to be that, which (two extremes being giuen) ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth out the meane by diuiding the extrems
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:11804:86"/> added together by their number. He addeth theſe wordes as if there be two extremes the diuiſor muſt be 2, if there be three extreames the diuiſor muſt be 3, and ſo foorth. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by this definition if corne at 16 pence and 12 pence a buſhell be mingled together to the quantitie of 28 buſhels as is aforeſaide, the price of a buſhell of mingled corne ſhall be 14 pence, for here the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the extremes is 2, and the extremes 16 and 12 being added make 28, ſo that if thou diuide 28 by 2, the quotient is 14.</p>
               <p>But let vs ſee how true this is: Here by the rule of prime alligation the counterchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the differences is in this manner:</p>
               <p>
                  <table>
                     <row>
                        <cell rows="2">14</cell>

                  </table>
               </p>
               <p>By the which counterchange it is inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that when there are taken two buſhels of corne at 16 pence, then muſt there be two al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo taken of 12 pence the buſhell. Therefore when there ſhall be 10 taken at 16 pence the buſhell, then ſhall there alſo be 10 taken at 12 pence the buſhell. The numbers of the ſimple meaſures 10 and 18 being added to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether make 28. Therefore I reaſon thus: If when 10 buſhels at 16 pence the buſhell are mingled with 18 buſhels at 12 pence the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell, the meane is then 14: therefore when 28 buſhels of theſe ſimple ſeueral cornes are ſo mingled, that the price of a mingled buſhell
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:11804:86"/> is 14 pence, then ſhall 10 buſhels at 16 pence the buſhell, be mingled with 18 buſhels at 12 pence the buſhell. (For it is all one way from Newhauſe to Heidelberge, and from Heidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge to Newhauſe.) But this ſecond aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is falſe (for here when 10 buſhels at 16 pence the buſhell are taken, then alſo there are taken 10 buſhels at 12 pence the buſhell as appeared before) therefore the firſt aſſertion is alſo falſe. Whether with 18, or with 10 bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhels at 12 pence a buſhell, you mingle 10 buſhels at 16 pence a buſhell, the extremes added together in both are 28, and their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is 2. Therefore whether you mingle 10 buſhels at 16 pence the buſhell, with 18, or 10 buſhels at 12 pence a buſhell, the price of a buſhell of mingled corne ſhall be all one, and ſo the price of the cheaper wheate ſhall be the price of the dearer wheate, which is abſurde.</p>
               <p>I alwaies reuerenced my maſter while he was a liue as my duetie required, and much more doe I now imbrace the writings of that moſt holy Martyr being dead. But it is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to a man to erre: and therefore he being a Philoſopher of moſt holy memorie, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thoſe men to be madde that thought it an hurtfull thing for a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth to haue their faults amended: therefore following his owne decree by my definition, I correct his in this place. For he himſelfe either did cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it before his death, or if he had liued any
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:11804:87"/> longer, I doubt not but he would willingly haue amended it: if he did correct it, truely it was neuer my chance as yet to ſee his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let 6 ounces of cloues at 36, and 8 ounces of cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon at 16, be mingled with 4 ounces of pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per at 15: how ſhall 4 ounces of the mingled ſpice be ſolde?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the numbers of the ſimple meaſures are 6, 8, and 4, whereof the totall is 18. The products of 36, 16, and 15, made by multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by 6, 8, and 4 are 216, 128, and 60. The totall of them is 404. Therefore I will ſay thus:</p>
               <p>18 ounces of mingled ſpice are worth 404 therefore 4 ounces are worth 89 7/9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let the prices of the ſimple ſpices be as they were before: and let 1/2 of an ounce of cloues, and 1/8 of an ounce of cinnamon be mingled with 1/4 of an ounce of pepper: vvhat ſhall an ounce of the mingled ſpice be worth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here firſt of all the vnlike meaſures which are giuen 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 muſt be made like. For the propertie of generall alligation requireth that the meaſures ſhould be like. Therefore by reduction of fractions to one denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4, I finde out 6/12, 4/12, and 3/12. Then that the worke may be more eaſie for the parts found out, by reduction of fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to whole numbers, I take 6, 4, and 3. The totall therefore of the numbers of the meaſures ſhall be 13. Then multiply 36, 16, &amp;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:11804:87"/> 15, by the numbers of their meaſures 6, 4, and 3, you ſhall produce 216, 64, and 45: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the totall is 325. Then ſhall you conclude the queſtion thus:</p>
               <p>13 ounces of mingled ſpice are worth 325, therefore one ounce is worth 25 3/13.</p>

               <p>For the reaſons giuen in the vppermoſt rowe of numbers (namely a ſubſeſquialtera, and a ſubſeſquiquarta) are in the nethermoſt row of numbers ſo continued and knit one to an other, that of the two middlemoſt termes there is made one, which according to the reaſons giuen in the firſt ranke of nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers is both the conſequent of the former, and the antecedent of the latter. For as 2 is
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:11804:88"/> vnto 3, ſo is 8 vnto 12: and as 4 is vnto 5, ſo is 12 vnto 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In this kind of proportion therefore there is intended an inuention or finding out of the leaſt termes continually proportionall vvith the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons giuen how many ſo euer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This inuention is ſet foorth in the 4 prop. 8, where it is demonſtrated by what meanes, how many reaſons ſo euer being giuen in the leaſt termes, you may finde out other leaſt termes continually proportionall, keeping the reaſons giuen. Let that probleme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be turned into two theoremes: whereof let the one concerne two reaſons giuen, and let the other concerne many reaſons giuen in this manner:</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>I</head>
                  <p>If the middlemoſt termes being prime one to another of the two reaſons giuen, be ſet croſſewayes, and then the former of the two multiply the termes of the firſt reaſon, and the latter the termes of the conſequent: the three products ſhall be the leaſt termes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually proportionall as the reaſons giuen are.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we are to note, that in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons giuen the middlemoſt termes are either prime numbers or compound, if they be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, they muſt be reduced to prime num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. As in 3, 2, 7, 4, the middlemoſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are prime numbers in reſpect one of an other. Wherefore being ſet croſſewiſe one
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:11804:88"/> vnder another, if you multiply 7 by 2 and 3, which are the termes of the former reaſon: and then multiply 2 by 7 and 4, which are the termes of the reaſon following, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts 21, 14, 8, ſhall be the leaſt numbers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually proportionall, as the numbers giuen are, as you ſee here:</p>

                  <p>For as 3 is vnto 2, ſo is 21 to 14: and as 7 is to 4, ſo is 14 to 8.</p>
                  <p>Let theſe two reaſons or proportions be giuen like one to an other 3, 2, 6, 4. Here 2 and 6 are compound numbers in reſpect one of another, wherfore I reduce them to prime or the leaſt numbers, namely to 1 and 3, and place them croſſewiſe, and multiply 3 into 3 and 2 the antecedents, and likewiſe 1 into 6 and 4 the conſequents, the products are 9, 6, 4, which are the leaſt termes continually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionall, as the reaſons giuen, according as you ſee them here written.</p>

                  <p>For example ſake, let there be three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons giuen 4 vnto 3, 2 vnto 1, 5 vnto 6, to be continued in the leaſt or prime proportionall termes.

And becauſe 3 (the laſt of them that are found out) is a prime number to 5 the antecedent of the reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining: therefore they being ſet croſſewiſe, let 5 multiply 8 and 6, the products are 40 and 30: but let 3 multiply the numbers fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing 5 and 6, the products are 15, 30, ſo that we haue now foure termes in the leaſt numbers continually proportionall as the three reaſons giuen were. The example is in this manner:</p>

                  <hi>HItherto of diſiunct proportion: now follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth continuall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Continuall proportion is that vvhoſe middle termes doe all ſupply the place of an antecedent, and a conſequent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In continuall proportion the firſt extreme is onely an antecedent, and the laſt is onely a conſequent: of the other termes, which are in the middeſt betweene the extremes any of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:11804:92"/> them in reſpect of that which went before it is a conſequent, in reſpect of that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth it is an antecedent, as this is in three termes 9, 6, 4, in foure termes, 8, 12, 18, 27, in fiue termes 32, 16, 8, 4, 2 &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Continuall proportion is either ſimple, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold, ſimple continuall proportion, is that wherin there is but one only meane betwene the extrems.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the 9 d. 5. which affirmeth that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion conſiſteth in three termes at the leaſt, as in 9, 6, 4, where the extremes 9 and 4 are lincked together by one onely terme. This is framed in the leaſt termes, if you multiply the termes of the reaſon giuen being prime in reſpect one of another, both by themſelues, and one by another, for the products are the termes of the continuall proportion, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the reaſon giuen. As for example, of 2, 1, which are the termes of a double reaſon, you ſhall make a ſimple continuall proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if you multiply 2 by it ſelfe, and then by 1, and laſt of all 1 by it ſelfe, for the products will be 4, 2, 1. Likewiſe of 3, 2, the termes of a ſeſquialter reaſon, you ſhall by the ſame meanes make 9, 6, 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The propertie of it is this: The product made of the extremes, is equall to the product made of the meane, and contrariwiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the 17 p. 6. concerning magnitudes, and alſo the 20 p. 7. where this propertie is alſo attributed vnto nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, becauſe in three proportionall numbers, the product made of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:11804:92" rendition="simple:additions"/> the extremes, is equall vnto the ſquare made of the meane. As in 9, 6, 4, the product made of 9 and 4, is 36, which is equall to the ſquare of the meane, namely vnto ſixe times ſixe, or which is all one to the product made of the meane multiplied by it ſelfe. For it is, as if you ſhold inferre the proportion diſiunctiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in foure termes after this manner:</p>
               <p>9 giue 6: therefore 6 giue 4.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is to be gathered, that this propertie is generall to all ſimple proportion whether it conſiſt of three or foure termes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manifold continuall proportion, is that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many meane termes proceede continually after one and the ſame reaſon. Hereupon it is called progreſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As 1, 2, 4, 8. Item 16, 24, 36, 54, 81.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In progreſſion we haue aneye to the finding out of the order of the terms making the progreſſion, or elſe to the ſumme of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The finding out of the termes is two fold: for either the terms giuen enter into the progreſſion, or elſe new termes are made by their meanes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the termes of a proportion giuen, can not be extended and continued. In manifold proportion it may be, but in other reaſons it can not ſo well be done. It ſhall appeare therefore by the theoreme following, what termes giuen will admit a progreſſion.</p>
               <p>If the laſt terme ſauing one doth diuide the product made of the laſt terme, the quotient ſhall be the proportionall terme following,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:11804:93" rendition="simple:additions"/> Or, If the laſt terme doth diuide the product made of the laſt ſauing one, the quotient ſhall be the antecedent proportionall.</p>
               <p>This Theoreme is gathered out of the 18 p. 9. It is alſo deduced as it were a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence out of the proprietie of continuall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby not onely proportion, but any reaſon giuen may be continued. As in 3, 9, 27, wherein 9 diuideth 729, the product made of the laſt number 27, the quotient is 81, which is the fourth proportionall number. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe let 9 which is the ſecond number diuide 9 which is the product made of the firſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 3, the quotient 1, is the firſt proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall number. So that the progreſſion ſhall be in this manner, 1, 3, 9, 27, 81. This conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the termes in manifold propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be infinitely inferred onely by the multiplication of the laſt terme by the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minator of the reaſon or proportion:</p>
               <p>Yet in thoſe whoſe reaſon is manifold, any terme ſought for may be found our readily in this manner:</p>
               <p>If you diuide the product made of the laſt number multiplied in it ſelfe, by any of the numbers which went before it: by how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny degrees the diuiſor went before the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber multiplied, by ſo many degrees ſhall the quotient followe the ſame number multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
               <p>For example ſake, let this double propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be giuen.</p>

               <p>And let 16 be the number to be multiplied by it ſelfe, th product is 256, diuide that by 8 which is the number next before it, the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient 32 is the number which muſt followe next after 16. But if you diuide the product 256 by 4 which went before 16 in the thirde place, the quotient will be 64, which muſt follow in the third place after 16. If you make the diuiſion by 2, which went before 16 in the fourth place, the quotient 128 muſt follow in the fourth place after 16, and ſo forth in the reſt. For it is as if you ſhould ſet the rule of proportion thus: If 2 giue 16: then 16 ſhall giue 128.</p>
               <p>Out of the foreſaid abridgement, another ariſeth, whereby we may finde out any terme of manifold progreſſion, in this manner:</p>
               <p>If ſome certaine termes of continuall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion be giuen, and the numbers follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another from an vnitie according to their naturall order, doe aunſwere the ſaide termes from the ſecond forward, the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of the product made by any of the termes whatſoeuer diuided by the firſt terme, ſhall be the terme of the progreſſion more by one, then both the numbers anſwering to the numbers multiplied, doe amount vnto being added together.</p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:11804:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>As in this triple proportion, let there be giuen ſome termes, and let the numbers be written vnderneath them in order as you ſee:</p>

               <p>Then if you multiply 27 by 81, and diuide the product 2187 by 3, which is the firſt nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the progreſſion, the quotient 729 ſhall be the ſixth terme of the progreſtion which is more by one, then 2 and 3 (that is to ſay 5) are. Likewiſe if you multiply 243 by it ſelfe, and diuide the product by the firſt, the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſhall be 19683, to be placed in the ninth place, and ſo forth of the reſt.</p>
               <p>The termes aſwell of manifolde reaſon as of proportion and progreſſion, may in this manner be continued infinitely. But the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of numbers doth not beare it ſo well in the other kinds of reaſon or proportion. For firſt of all, if of the reaſon giuen the termes be prime numbers one to another, then can not a third, much leſſe a fourth or fifth in whole numbers be adioyned to them in continuall proportion: as it appeareth by the 16 p. of the 9. As in the reaſon of 3 to 5, which is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perpartient two fifts, you ſhall neuer bring forth a continuall proportion, vnleſſe you ioyne to it this mixt or ſurde number 8 1/3, which cannot be expreſſed by an whole nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Likewiſe how many proportionall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:11804:94"/> ſoeuer being giuen, if the extremes be prime one to another, no ſuch number can be giuen at the laſt, as the ſecond is vnto the firſt, by the 17 p. of the 9. As in this ſubſeſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alter 4, 6, 9, becauſe 4 and 9 are prime one to another, therefore there can be no whole number in ſuch proportionalitie vnto 9, as 4 is vnto 6. Therefore in ſuch kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions this Theoreme following taketh place.</p>
               <p>If the termes of continuall ſimple propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not admitting an vſuall progreſſion be multiplied by the antecedent of the reaſon whereof they conſiſt, and the laſt be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by his conſequent: there ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced foure leaſt termes continually propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall according to the numbers giuen: and ſo forth continually by multiplying the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts by the antecedent giuen, and the laſt by the conſequent giuen, you ſhall find the leaſt termes how many ſo euer continually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionall according to the reaſons giuen:</p>
               <p>As for example, ſeeing that this ſeſquiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia 16, 12, 9, hath not a fourth number in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. Therefore firſt of all, I multiply all the numbers giuen by 4, the antecedent of the reaſon giuen betweene 4 and 3, whereof they were made: the products ſhall be 64, 48, 36. Likewiſe I multiply the laſt number 9 by 3 the conſequent giuen, the product is 27, the which numbers are all continually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionall next vnto the numbers giuen.

                  <hi>Thus much concerning the ranging of the termes: now followeth the ſumme of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The finding out of the ſumme, is that vvhich (the firſt terme of the progreſſion increaſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubducted from the ſec<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ond and the laſt) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto the laſt terme giuen a number, to the which the remainder of the laſt terme hath ſuch proportion as the remainder of the ſecond terme hath vnto the firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſaid (the progreſſion increaſing) that ye may vnderſtande that the firſt terme is here taken for the leaſt, and the laſt for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. Now the maſterie of this inuention is generall, being not onely of force in mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold proportion, as that rule is which the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of Arithmeticians do preſcribe, but all progreſſion of what proportionalitie ſo
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:11804:95"/> euer giuen: It is taken out of the 33 prop. 9. which affirmeth this, of how many propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall numbers ſoeuer following one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If from the ſecond and the laſt terme there be taken away numbers equall to the firſt, the remainder of the laſt terme ſhall be vnto all the antecedents going before it, as the remainder of the ſecond terme is vnto the firſt terme. Therefore theſe three proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall termes being found out, you ſhall ſet the exceſſe or the remainder of the laſt terme in the third place, and the remainder of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in the firſt place, and the firſt or leaſt terme of the progreſſion in the middlemoſt place, and then worke by the rule of three, whereby you ſhall inferre a number contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all them which were antecedents to the laſt, which being therefore added to the laſt ſhall containe the ſumme of them all.</p>
               <p>As in this manifold progreſſion, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, if 2 be taken from 4, and 32, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine 2 and 30. Now as 2 the remainder of the ſecond terme is vnto the firſt terme 2, ſo is 30 vnto all the antecedents. Therefore for the working of the rule, the termes ſhall ſtand thus:</p>
               <p>2 giue 2: therefore 30 giue 30.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is in ech place alike and equall. Therefore ſeeing that the totall made of the numbers going before the laſt is 30, it being added to the laſt, namely vnto 32, declareth the ſumme of the progreſſion to be 62.</p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:11804:96"/>
               <p>Likewiſe in this ſubtriple progreſſion, 2, 6, 18, 54, let 2 be taken from 6 and 54, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders ſhall be 4 and 52. Now as 4 the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the ſecond terme is vnto the firſt terme 2, ſo is 52 the remainder of the laſt terme vnto all the antecedents. Wherefore the three termes knowne ſhall be thus orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the finding out of the fourth terme.</p>
               <p>4 2: therefore 52 26</p>
               <p>And for ſo much as this fourth number, is equall vnto all the antecedents, it being added to the laſt terme 54, the totall 80 ſhall be the ſumme of the progreſſion.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe let there be this ſubſeſquialter progreſſion, 16, 24, 36, 54, 81. The remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the ſecond, and laſt terme are 8, and 65, whereupon by theſe three proportionall numbers 8, 16, 65, the fourth number 130 is inferred, which is the totall made of all the antecedents except the laſt, it being therfore added vnto the laſt terme 81, declareth the ſumme of the progreſſion to be 211. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeareth that the firſt, ſecond, and laſt terme of the progreſſion being knowen the ſumme cannot lie hid.</p>
               <p>An Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A certaine man ſolde his houſe to be payde for it in wheate after ſuch a manner, that vvhen he that bought it came in at the firſt doore he ſhould giue him one graine, at the ſecond two, at the third 4, and ſo foorth proceeding conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:11804:96"/> by double proportion according to the number of the doores. He that ſhrunke from his bargaine ſhould pay to the other 12 crowns for a penaltie. Now being 60 doores, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is how much wheat he was to pay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A rich man of Baſill not ignorant of the huge increaſe of Geometricall progreſſion, ſold his houſe ſometimes vppon this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being among his cuppes. But the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his bargaine being brought vnto an account, the number of the wheat was found to be vnmeaſurable, ſo that all the houſes of Baſill being turned in garners, were not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to receiue it. I thought good to ſet downe the example. Let the 60 terme of the progreſſion be compendiouſly found out.</p>

Where by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that if a right line be cut into two ſeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, how ſoeuer, the ſquare of the whole line is equall to the ſquares of the ſegments, and to the two right angled figures made of the ſegments: as in the figure here annexed, the two Diagonals k g, and b f, are the ſquares of the ſegments a b, and a c. Alſo the complements b k and f g, are the right-angled figures made by multiplying the line a b by b c.</p>
            <p>The ſelfe ſame parts are to be found in any ſquare number. As for example in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 169, whoſe ſide is 13.

            <p>Therefore as the Square 169 is made by the adding together of theſe foure plane numbes, ſo by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting them ſeuerally it is reſolued. Firſt therefore I marke each odde place with points becauſe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſquares are to be found in the odde places. Then for ſo much as the vnitie ſtanding vnder the firſt point next vnto the left hand, and repreſenting the laſt period, is both a ſquare and the ſide of a ſquare: that figure therefore being ſet alone by it ſelfe in the quotient, and being ſubducted from the vnity ſtanding ouer the point, there remaineth nothing. This vnitie ſet alone by it ſelfe in the quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſhall ſignifie 10, when another figure is ſet by it repreſenting the ſide of ſome other particular ſquare. Whereupon I ſay, that the greater Diagonall kg, is nowe ſubducted from the whole ſquare, and the ſide of it k i or a b (for they are equall one to another) and alſo the ſide of one of the complements is found out. This is the firſt ſteppe to this reſolution.</p>
            <p>Moreouer I double the figure found out, becauſe being doubled, it is the ſide of both the complements taken ioyntly together, namely k i and g i. Then ſetting 2 the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled number vnder 6, I diuide 6, (which in this place is as much as 60, and repreſenteth both the complements) by 2, the quotient 10
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:11804:99"/> 3, repreſenting the other ſide remaining of the compleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, namely, i f, or b c, the which number I ſet in the quotient, and count it for the ſegment remaining of the right line gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Wherefore becauſe this number 3 is the ſide of the Diagonall remayning, that is to ſay, of the leſſer ſquare b f: therefore being ſet by the diuiſor on the right hand, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed both by it ſelfe, and by the diuiſor, it bringeth forth three plane numbers, namely, the ſquare b f, and the two complements a i and i l, which being ſubducted from the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Take this for an other example to make this deuiſe more plaine. Let the Square giuen be 1764. This number being marked with two points telleth vs that the ſide thereof is to be written with two figures. Firſt therfore beginning at the point on the left hande, I ſeeke the ſide of the laſt periode, namely of 17. But for ſo much as it is no ſquare num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I take 4 the ſide of the next leſſer ſquare, which I ſet alone by it ſelfe in the quotient, and then multiply it by it ſelfe, the product
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:11804:100"/> is 16, which being ſubducted from 17 there remaineth 1. Moreouer, I double the ſide found out, the product is 8, I place this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled number vnder 6, and by it I diuide 16 ſtanding aboue it, the quotient is 2, which muſt be ſet by 4. This quotient 2 muſt be ſet before the diuiſor 8 on the right hand vnder the point, and then muſt it be multiplied both into it ſelfe and into 8, the product is 164, which being ſubducted from the figures ſtanding ouer them, there remaineth nothing, whereby I gather that the number giuen is a iuſt Square. The example ſtandeth thus:</p>
            <gap reason="math">
               <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
            </gap>
            <p>The ſame manner of working is to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in greater ſquare number giuen, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that the former part of the worke is to be vſed but once, but the latter part is to be followed ſo many times as there are pointes remaining, excepting the laſt. As in 54756, I ſay, that the ſide of the ſquare next vnto 5 is 2, therefore 2 being ſet in the quotient, and multiplied by it ſelfe make 4, and taken from 5, the remainder is one. Moreouer I double the quotient, the product is 4, which I ſet vnder the next figure toward the right hand,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:11804:100"/> and thereby diuide 14, the quotient is 3, the which 3 being ſet both in the quotient, and alſo before the diuiſor toward the right hand, I multiply both the numbers by it, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is 129, this being ſubducted from 147 ſtanding aboue it, the remainder is 18. But becauſe there is yet one point remaining with the which I haue not medled, therfore againe I double all the whole quotient. For in this caſe I muſt take 23 for the one ſide of one former ſquare, and generally in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers when I light vppon more particular ſquares then two, I muſt eſteeme them but as two, and take the ſides which are firſt found out but as the ſides of one only ſquare. Therefore twiſe 23 are 46, by this I diuide 185, the number to be ſet in the quotient is 4, the which number alſo muſt bee ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diuiſor on the right hande, then muſt 464 be multiplied by 4, the product is 1856, this product beeing ſubducted from the numbers ſtanding ouer it, there remaineth nothing. The example ſtandeth thus:</p>
            <gap reason="math">

            <p>See alſo the example following:</p>
            <p>10̇94̇28̇64̇ (3308</p>
            <p>Out of this inuention this concluſion fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:</p>
            <p>The number whoſe ſide cannot be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by whole numbers, is no ſquare number.</p>
            <p>Such are all prime numbers, &amp; (the ſquares themſelues excepted) all other compound numbers. For if in them you deſire to finde out the ſquare ſide, you ſhall labour in vaine, becauſe they are not ſquares for to the whole numbers ariſing in the quotient, there will be ſome fraction adioyned, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that the number of the ſide is not to be expreſſed by a true number, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it is called a ſurde number.</p>
            <p>Yet if you adioyne to the ſide found out the number remaining, taking his denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from the double of the ſide augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an vnitie, you ſhall finde the next ſide that may be like to the ſide of a ſquare.</p>
            <p>As if from 40 you take the neareſt ſquare, namely 36, the remainder is 4. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſide ſought for of the ſquare, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not the ſide found out by an vnitie, but either by one, or more parts of ſome whole number: wherefore I double 6 the ſide found out, and adde an vnitie to it being doubled, the totall is 13, this number I ſet vnder 4 the remainder, and ſay that the ſide of 40 ſought as neare as may be, is 6 4/13, the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the fraction being added to the greateſt
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:11804:101" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſquare in the number giuen, namely vnto 36, maketh the next greateſt ſquare aboue it, namely 49, whoſe ſide is 7. But this ſurde ſide namely 6 4/13, multiplyed by it ſelfe maketh 39 133/169, which are not iuſt equall vnto 40 the number giuen. The like iudgement may be vſed in the reſt which are not ſquares.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus much concerning plane numbers, but eſpecially ſuch as are ſquare numbers. The ſolide number followeth, which is a number made of three numbers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17 d. 7. A ſolide number is made by a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold multiplication, euen as a ſolide bodie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong magnitudes is made by a twofold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion: the firſt is like that which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a plane figure, the ſecond is like that which maketh a body. As three times 4 taken fiue times: for three times 4 are 12, this is a plane number, fiue times 12 are 60, this is a ſolide number.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A ſolide number is made either of 3 equall numbers as a Cube: or of 3 vnequall numbers as an Oblong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>19 d. 7. A cube in numbers is made by multiplying the ſide thereof by the ſquare of the ſide: whereby we may gather, that to multiply a number cubically, is to multiply the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber made of it ſelfe, by himſelfe againe as foure times 4 foure times are 64, which is a cube hauing relation to a Geometrical thing, partly becauſe their making is like, partly alſo becauſe the vnities of the number ſet in
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:11804:102"/> a certaine diſtance one from another reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a cube.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The cube is knowne by finding out the ſide ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by a whole number.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For euery Cube in numbers hath ſuch a ſide as may be expreſſed by whole numbers, but in magnitudes it is not alwayes ſo, as in deede in magnitudes there are many things not to be expreſſed by whole numbers. Now for ſo much as the ſide of any Cube vnder 1000 is a ſimple figure, it is meete before we vndertake to find out the ſide of any greater number, that we ſhould know what Cube is made of each ſimple figure, and what is the ſide of any Cube leſſer then 1000, as I haue here ſet them downe.</p>

            <p>The ſame way therefore that is kept in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Cube, is alſo to be followed in reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Cube. As for example, I marke the cube giuen with points in this manner, 2197. Then I ſubduct the particular cube of the number ſet vnder neath the laſt point: but for ſo much as that number is no Cube, I take the neareſt to it, namely an vnitie, which alſo I ſet in the quotient. This vnitie in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber giuen is 1000, but in the quotient it is but 10. The vnitie ſubducted from 2, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:11804:104"/> is 1, which muſt be written ouer the number giuen. So that the greater cube A is to be ſuppoſed to be ſubducted from the number giuen. This is the firſt ſteppe of this worke:</p>
            <gap reason="math">
               <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
            </gap>
            <p>I triple the quotient found out (that is to ſay, I multiply it by 3) this triple repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the three ſides taken iointly together of the three leſſer ſolides marked with C, I place the tripled number vnder 9. Againe I mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply the quotient ſquarewiſe, and triple the product which maketh likewiſe 3. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct reſembleth the three ſquared ſides taken iointly together of the three greater ſolides, marked with D, I place the product one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree lower toward the left hande vnderneath 1. With it I diuide 11, which is written aboue it, the quotient is 3. This ſegment or quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient 3, being multiplied by 3 the diuiſor, maketh 9, which in reſpect of the place wherein it ſtandeth is 900, and repreſenteth the three greater ſolides marked with D ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken iointly together. Furthermore the ſame quotient being multiplyed ſquarewiſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth 9, and multiplied afterwarde by the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled number ſtanding vnder 9, it maketh 27, which in reſpect of the place wherein it ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth is 270, and repreſenteth the three leſſer
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:11804:104"/> ſolides marked with C. Laſt of all, the ſame quotient multiplyed cubically, breedeth the leſſer Cube B. Theſe three products therefore being added together, and the totall ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the numbers ſtanding ouer it, there remaineth nothing, which importeth that the number giuen is a Cube. The example is as you ſee:</p>
            <gap reason="math">
               <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
            </gap>
            <p>Take theſe examples following to make the matter more plane. Let the ſide be ſought out of this Cube, 16387064: contriue it ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as it were) into certaine periods with points. Then firſt of all, ſeeke out the ſide of the cube, which you find in the laſt number ouer the point next to the left hand. But for ſo much as 16 is no cube, take 2 the ſide of the next cube vnder it that is to ſay, of 8, and ſet it in the quotient, and ſubduct 8 the cube from 16, there remaine 8. This firſt worke is not to be renewed throughout the whole number, but the rules following muſt be
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:11804:105"/> repeated as often as there are pointes remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The firſt ſteppe to finde out the ſide is in this manner.</p>
            <gap reason="math">
               <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
            </gap>
            <p>Moreouer triple the quotient found out, the product is 6, which are to be placed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 8, namely vnder the figure following the next pricke toward the right hande. Then multiplie the quotient by this tripled num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (or which is all to one purpoſe, ſquare the quotient, and then triple the products) it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth 12, ſet that number in a lower place one degree nearer to the left hand: and make it the diuiſor. Diuide 83 by 12, obſeruing this rule in choſing your quotient, that it be no greater, then that the numbers afterwarde produced by multiplication may not exceede the numbers ſtanding ouer it. So that here you ſhal take 1 in 8, but fiue times. Afterward by this number 5, multiply the diuiſor 12, and by the ſquare of 5 multiply the trebled num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 6, and laſt of all, multiply 5 cubically, ſo ſhall you produce three numbers, namely 60, 150, 125, to be deſcribed as you ſee: Theſe numbers added together, and ſubducted from 8387, the remainder is 762. The ſeconde ſteppe to finde out the ſide is in this manner:</p>
            <pb n="211" facs="tcp:11804:105"/>
            <gap reason="math">
               <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
            </gap>
            <p>And becauſe there is yet one point remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, this laſt manner of diuiſion muſt be wrought againe. Firſt therefore I triple the quotient, the product is 75, which muſt be ſo placed, that the firſt figure thereof, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 5, may ſtand vnder 6, the ſecond vnder the 0. Againe multiply the quotient by this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled number (or which is all one, ſquare the quotient, and triple the product) it maketh 1875, which ſhall be the diuiſor, whoſe firſt figure namely 5, muſt be placed vnder 7, the laſt figure of the tripled number. Then you ſee that I may be contayned in 7 many times, but I can take it but foure times, I ſet 4 in the quotient, and multiply the diuiſor by 4, the product is 7500, afterward I ſquare 4, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth 16, which I multiply by the tripled nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 75, the product is 1200. Laſt of all, I multiply 4 cubically it maketh 64: theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts added all together make 762064, this number being ſubducted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Cube, there remaineth nothing, whereby I gather that
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:11804:106"/> the number giuen is a iuſt Cube. The third ſteppe to finde out the ſide is in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</p>
            <gap reason="math">
               <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
            </gap>
            <p>Behold alſo the example following: 614̇125̇000̇ (850</p>
            <p>Another manner of working:</p>
            <p>Hitherto the princely high way to finde out the ſide of the Cube hath beene declared.</p>
            <p>But there are other waies alſo bending thereto, and leaning to the ſame principles: whereof this is one.</p>
            <p>Hauing found out in the Table of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cubes, the figure repreſenting the ſide of the cube contained in the number ſtanding vnder the firſt point on the left hand, ſet it in the quotient, and ſubduct the particular cube of that figure as you did before: then ſquare, that figure, and triple the ſquare, the product ſhall be the diuiſor, whoſe firſt figure ſhall
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:11804:106"/> be ſet vnder that figure which is on the right hand next of all to the firſt point afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide.</p>
            <p>2 See how many times the diuiſor is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the number written ouer it, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the diuiſor by the quotient, and ſubduct the product from the diuidend. Yet here you muſt take heede, that you chooſe not a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quotient, then that the products made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward thereby may be ſubducted from the numbers giuen.</p>
            <p>3 When the ſubduction is done, triple the firſt figure which was ſet in the quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and place the laſt number which was ſet in the quotient on the right hand of the product.</p>
            <p>4 Multiply this whole number by the ſquare of the quotient laſt found out, and ſet downe the product ſo, that the firſt figure thereof toward the right hand may ſtand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the point next going before on the ſame hand, and then ſubduct it from the number giuen.</p>
            <p>As in 804̇357̇ the particular Cube, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 729, being taken from the number ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnder the laſt period vpon the left hand there remaine 75357, the ſide of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cube is 9, which I ſet in the quotient. I ſquare that ſide, it maketh 81, and triple the ſquare, the product 243 is my diuiſor, which I ſet vnder the number giuen, ſo that 3 may ſtand vnder 3. With this diuiſor diuide the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:11804:107"/> number ſtanding ouer it, you ſhall finde 2 to be contained in 7 three times. I ſet therefore 3 in the quotient, and multiply the diuiſor by it, the product is 729, which being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted from 753, the remainder is 24. As you ſee in this induction.</p>
            <gap reason="math">
               <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
            </gap>
            <p>Moreouer I I triple 9, the product is 27, by the which on the right hand I ſet 3 the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient laſt found out, the totall is 273. This nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I multiply by 9 the ſquare of 3 the quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent laſt found out, the product is 2457, which being ſubducted from the number ſtanding ouer it, there remaineth nothing. The indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is on this manner:</p>
            <gap reason="math">
               <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
            </gap>
            <p>The ſelfe ſame worke may be diſpatched another way ſomewhat differing from the former in this maner. The figure in the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient being found out by ſubducting the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cube, and alſo the ſecond figure in the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:11804:107"/> quotient being found by diuiſion, let the whole quotient be tripled, and let the tripled number be multiplied by the former figure in the quotient. Then let the product be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied againe by the latter figure found out, and let a cypher be ſet on the right hande of that product. Laſt of all, let the cube of the latter figure found out be added to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and let the totall ſumme be ſubducted from the number giuen. As in 373248. The firſt induction is in this manner:</p>
            <gap reason="math">
               <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
            </gap>
            <p>Moreouer I ſquare the ſide found out, it maketh 49 and triple the ſquare, the product is 147, which ſhall be the diuiſor, by this I diuide 302, the number written ouer it, the quotient is 2. Now I triple the whole quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient 72, it maketh 216, and multiply this triple by 7, the former figure in the quotient, the product is 1512. I multiply alſo this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct by 2 the latter figure of the quotient, and ſet a cypher on the right hande of it, ſo that it maketh 30240, vnto this number I adde 8 the cube of the latter figure found out, the totall is 30248, which being ſubducted from the figures aboue it, there remaineth nothing. The induction is thus:</p>

            <p>All the points of the number giuen being examined, if any thing remaine, it ſignifieth that the number giuen is no Cube: wherefore the true ſide of it cannot be giuen exactly in numbers. Yet if it pleaſe you to ſift out the neareſt ſide that may be, by the firſt kinde of reduction of mixt numbers, you muſt reduce the number giuen into a cubicall fraction of a great denomination, and afterwarde ſeeke out the cubicall ſide of that fraction.</p>
            <p>For example ſake, becauſe 120 is no Cube, therefore let it be reduced into ſixtie cubicall parts, after this manner. Multiply 60 cubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally in it ſelfe, it maketh 216000, by this being taken for the denominator of the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, multiply 120 the number giuen, the product is 25920000, whoſe cubicall ſide is 295/60 that is, 4 11/12 the neareſt to the true ſide that may be.</p>
